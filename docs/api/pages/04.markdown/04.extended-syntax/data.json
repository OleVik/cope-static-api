{"attributes":{"title":"Extended Syntax","subtitle":"Advanced features that build on the basic Markdown syntax."},"body":"The [basic syntax](/basic-syntax) outlined in John Gruber's original design document added many of the elements needed on a day-to-day basis, but it wasn't enough for some people. That's where extended syntax comes in.\n\nSeveral individuals and organizations took it upon themselves to extend the basic syntax by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. These elements can be enabled by using a lightweight markup language that builds upon the basic Markdown syntax, or by adding an extension to a compatible Markdown processor.\n\n## Availability\n\nNot all Markdown applications support extended syntax elements. You'll need to check whether or not the lightweight markup language your application is using supports the extended syntax elements you want to use. If it doesn't, it may still be possible to enable extensions in your Markdown processor.\n\n### Lightweight Markup Languages\n\nThere are several lightweight markup languages that are *supersets* of Markdown. They include Gruber's basic syntax and build upon it by adding additional elements like tables, code blocks, syntax highlighting, URL auto-linking, and footnotes. Many of the most popular Markdown applications use one of the following lightweight markup languages:\n\n- [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org)\n- [GitHub Flavored Markdown (GFM)](https://github.github.com/gfm/)\n- [Markdown Extra](https://michelf.ca/projects/php-markdown/extra/)\n- [MultiMarkdown](https://fletcherpenney.net/multimarkdown/)\n- [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)\n\n### Markdown Processors\n\nThere are [dozens of Markdown processors](https://github.com/markdown/markdown.github.com/wiki/Implementations) available. Many of them allow you to add extensions that enable extended syntax elements. Check your processor's documentation for more information.\n\n## Tables\n\nTo add a table, use three or more hyphens (`---`) to create each column's header, and use pipes (`|`) to separate each column. You can optionally add pipes on either end of the table.\n\n```\n| Syntax      | Description |\n| ----------- | ----------- |\n| Header      | Title       |\n| Paragraph   | Text        |\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th>Syntax</th>\n      <th>Description</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Header</td>\n      <td>Title</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td>Paragraph</td>\n      <td>Text</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nCell widths can vary, as shown below. The rendered output will look the same.\n\n```\n| Syntax | Description |\n| --- | ----------- |\n| Header | Title |\n| Paragraph | Text |\n```\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n  <i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> Creating tables with hyphens and pipes can be tedious. To speed up the process, try using the <a href=\"https://www.tablesgenerator.com/markdown_tables\">Markdown Tables Generator</a>. Build a table using the graphical interface, and then copy the generated Markdown-formatted text into your file.\n</div>\n\n### Alignment\n\nYou can align text in the columns to the left, right, or center by adding a colon (`:`) to the left, right, or on both side of the hyphens within the header row.\n\n```\n| Syntax      | Description | Test Text     |\n| :---        |    :----:   |          ---: |\n| Header      | Title       | Here's this   |\n| Paragraph   | Text        | And more      |\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr>\n      <th style=\"text-align: left\">Syntax</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align: center\">Description</th>\n      <th style=\"text-align: right\">Test Text</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Header</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: center\">Title</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">Here’s this</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <td style=\"text-align: left\">Paragraph</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: center\">Text</td>\n      <td style=\"text-align: right\">And more</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\n### Formatting Text in Tables\n\nYou can format the text within tables. For example, you can add [links](/basic-syntax/#links), [code](/basic-syntax/#code-1) (words or phrases in backticks (`` ` ``) only, not [code blocks](/basic-syntax/#code-blocks)), and [emphasis](/basic-syntax/#emphasis).\n\nYou can't add headings, blockquotes, lists, horizontal rules, images, or HTML tags.\n\n### Escaping Pipe Characters in Tables\n\nYou can display a pipe (`|`) character in a table by using its HTML character code (`&#124;`).\n\n## Fenced Code Blocks\n\nThe basic Markdown syntax allows you to create [code blocks](/basic-syntax#code-blocks) by indenting lines by four spaces or one tab. If you find that inconvenient, try using fenced code blocks. Depending on your Markdown processor or editor, you'll use three backticks (<code>```</code>) or three tildes (`~~~`) on the lines before and after the code block. The best part? You don't have to indent any lines!\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n```\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n```text\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n  <i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> Need to display backticks inside a code block? See <a href=\"/basic-syntax/#escaping-backticks\">this section</a> to learn how to escape them.\n</div>\n\n### Syntax Highlighting\n\nMany Markdown processors support syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks. This feature allows you to add color highlighting for whatever language your code was written in. To add syntax highlighting, specify a language next to the backticks before the fenced code block.\n\n~~~~~~~~~\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firstName\": \"John\",\n  \"lastName\": \"Smith\",\n  \"age\": 25\n}\n```\n\n## Footnotes\n\nFootnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\n\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets (`[^1]`). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can't contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\n\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text (`[^1]: My footnote.`). You don't have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\n\n```\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\n\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\n\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n    `{ my code }`\n\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nHere's a simple footnote,[^1] and here's a longer one.[^bignote]\n\n[^1]: This is the first footnote.\n\n[^bignote]: Here's one with multiple paragraphs and code.\n\n    Indent paragraphs to include them in the footnote.\n\n    `{ my code }`\n\n    Add as many paragraphs as you like.\n\n## Heading IDs\n\nMany Markdown processors support custom IDs for [headings](/basic-syntax/#headings) — some Markdown processors automatically add them. Adding custom IDs allows you to link directly to headings and modify them with CSS. To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading.\n\n```text\n### My Great Heading {#custom-id}\n```\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n```html\n<h3 id=\"custom-id\">My Great Heading</h3>\n```\n\n### Linking to Heading IDs\n\nYou can link to headings with custom IDs in the file by creating a [standard link](/basic-syntax/#links) with a number sign (`#`) followed by the custom heading ID.\n\n<table class=\"table table-bordered\">\n  <thead class=\"thead-light\">\n    <tr>\n      <th>Markdown</th>\n      <th>HTML</th>\n      <th>Rendered Output</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\">[Heading IDs](#heading-ids)</code></td>\n      <td><code class=\"highlighter-rouge\"> &lt;a href=\"#heading-ids\"&gt;Heading IDs&lt;/a&gt;</code></td>\n      <td><a href=\"#heading-ids\">Heading IDs</a></td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n\nOther websites can link to the heading by adding the custom heading ID to the full URL of the webpage (e.g, `[Heading IDs](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax#heading-ids)`).\n\n## Definition Lists\n\nSome Markdown processors allow you to create *definition lists* of terms and their corresponding definitions. To create a definition list, type the term on the first line. On the next line, type a colon followed by a space and the definition.  \n\n```\nFirst Term\n: This is the definition of the first term.\n\nSecond Term\n: This is one definition of the second term.\n: This is another definition of the second term.\n```\n\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\n```html\n<dl>\n  <dt>First Term</dt>\n  <dd>This is the definition of the first term.</dd>\n  <dt>Second Term</dt>\n  <dd>This is one definition of the second term. </dd>\n  <dd>This is another definition of the second term.</dd>\n</dl>\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nFirst Term\n: This is the definition of the first term.\n\nSecond Term\n: This is one definition of the second term.\n: This is another definition of the second term.\n\n## Strikethrough\n\nYou can strikethrough words by putting a horizontal line through the center of them. The result looks ~~like this~~. This feature allows you to indicate that certain words are a mistake not meant for inclusion in the document. To strikethrough words, use two tilde symbols (`~~`) before and after the words.\n\n```\n~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n~~The world is flat.~~ We now know that the world is round.\n\n## Task Lists\n\nTask lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (`-`) and brackets with a space (`[ ]`) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an `x` in between the brackets (`[x]`).\n\n```\n- [x] Write the press release\n- [ ] Update the website\n- [ ] Contact the media\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n![Markdown task list](tasklist.png)\n\n## Emoji\n\nThere are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files: copy and paste the emoji into your Markdown-formatted text, or type *emoji shortcodes*.\n\n### Copying and Pasting Emoji\n\nIn most cases, you can simply copy an emoji from a source like [Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) and paste it into your document. Many Markdown applications will automatically display the emoji in the Markdown-formatted text. The HTML and PDF files you export from your Markdown application should display the emoji.\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-success\">\n  <i class=\"fas fa-lightbulb\"></i> <strong>Tip:</strong> If you're using a static site generator, make sure you <a href=\"https://www.w3.org/International/tutorials/tutorial-char-enc/\">encode HTML pages as UTF-8</a>.\n</div>\n\n### Using Emoji Shortcodes\n\nSome Markdown applications allow you to insert emoji by typing emoji shortcodes. These begin and end with a colon and include the name of an emoji.\n\n```text\nGone camping! :tent: Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! :joy:\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\nGone camping! ⛺ Be back soon.\n\nThat is so funny! 😂\n\n<div class=\"alert alert-info\">\n  <i class=\"fas fa-info-circle\"></i> <strong>Note:</strong> You can use this <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/rxaviers/7360908\">list of emoji shortcodes</a>, but keep in mind that emoji shortcodes vary from application to application. Refer to your Markdown application's documentation for more information.\n</div>\n\n## Automatic URL Linking\n\nMany Markdown processors automatically turn URLs into links. That means if you type http://www.example.com, your Markdown processor will automatically turn it into a link even though you haven’t [used brackets](/basic-syntax/#links).\n\n```\nhttp://www.example.com\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n[http://www.example.com](http://www.example.com)\n\n## Disabling Automatic URL Linking\n\nIf you don't want a URL to be automatically linked, you can remove the link by [denoting the URL as code](/basic-syntax/#code) with backticks.\n\n```\n`http://www.example.com`\n```\n\nThe rendered output looks like this:\n\n`http://www.example.com`\n","bodyBegin":6,"frontmatter":"title: Extended Syntax\nsubtitle: Advanced features that build on the basic Markdown syntax."}
