{"attributes":{},"body":"man he acquired complete influence over her, and he gave her to\r\nunderstand that in the event of her obtaining a divorce from her husband\r\nhe would marry her. His plans were suddenly brought to a head by his\r\nknowledge that Sir Charles was about to leave the Hall on the advice of\r\nDr. Mortimer, with whose opinion he himself pretended to coincide. He\r\nmust act at once, or his victim might get beyond his power. He therefore\r\nput pressure upon Mrs. Lyons to write this letter, imploring the old man\r\nto give her an interview on the evening before his departure for London.\r\nHe then, by a specious argument, prevented her from going, and so had\r\nthe chance for which he had waited.\r\n\r\nDriving back in the evening from Coombe Tracey he was in time to get\r\nhis hound, to treat it with his infernal paint, and to bring the beast\r\nround to the gate at which he had reason to expect that he would find\r\nthe old gentleman waiting. The dog, incited by its master, sprang over\r\nthe wicket-gate and pursued the unfortunate baronet, who fled screaming\r\ndown the Yew Alley. In that gloomy tunnel it must indeed have been a\r\ndreadful sight to see that huge black creature, with its flaming jaws\r\nand blazing eyes, bounding after its victim. He fell dead at the end of\r\nthe alley from heart disease and terror. The hound had kept upon the\r\ngrassy border while the baronet had run down the path, so that no track\r\nbut the man's was visible. On seeing him lying still the creature had\r\nprobably approached to sniff at him, but finding him dead had turned\r\naway again. It was then that it left the print which was actually\r\nobserved by Dr. Mortimer. The hound was called off and hurried away to\r\nits lair in the Grimpen Mire, and a mystery was left which puzzled the\r\nauthorities, alarmed the country-side, and finally brought the case\r\nwithin the scope of our observation.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
