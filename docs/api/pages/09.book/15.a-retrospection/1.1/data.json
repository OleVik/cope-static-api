{"attributes":{},"body":"It was the end of November and Holmes and I sat, upon a raw and foggy\r\nnight, on either side of a blazing fire in our sitting-room in Baker\r\nStreet. Since the tragic upshot of our visit to Devonshire he had been\r\nengaged in two affairs of the utmost importance, in the first of which\r\nhe had exposed the atrocious conduct of Colonel Upwood in connection\r\nwith the famous card scandal of the Nonpareil Club, while in the second\r\nhe had defended the unfortunate Mme. Montpensier from the charge of\r\nmurder which hung over her in connection with the death of her\r\nstep-daughter, Mlle. Carere, the young lady who, as it will be\r\nremembered, was found six months later alive and married in New York. My\r\nfriend was in excellent spirits over the success which had attended a\r\nsuccession of difficult and important cases, so that I was able to\r\ninduce him to discuss the details of the Baskerville mystery. I had\r\nwaited patiently for the opportunity, for I was aware that he would\r\nnever permit cases to overlap, and that his clear and logical mind would\r\nnot be drawn from its present work to dwell upon memories of the past.\r\nSir Henry and Dr. Mortimer were, however, in London, on their way to\r\nthat long voyage which had been recommended for the restoration of his\r\nshattered nerves. They had called upon us that very afternoon, so that\r\nit was natural that the subject should come up for discussion.\r\n\r\nThe whole course of events, said Holmes, from the point of view of\r\nthe man who called himself Stapleton was simple and direct, although to\r\nus, who had no means in the beginning of knowing the motives of his\r\nactions and could only learn part of the facts, it all appeared\r\nexceedingly complex. I have had the advantage of two conversations with\r\nMrs. Stapleton, and the case has now been so entirely cleared up that I\r\nam not aware that there is anything which has remained a secret to us.\r\nYou\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
