{"attributes":{},"body":"But there was no sign within it of that desperate and defiant villain\r\nwhom we expected to see. Instead we were faced by an object so strange\r\nand so unexpected that we stood for a moment staring at it in amazement.\r\n\r\nThe room had been fashioned into a small museum, and the walls were\r\nlined by a number of glass-topped cases full of that collection of\r\nbutterflies and moths the formation of which had been the relaxation of\r\nthis complex and dangerous man. In the centre of this room there was an\r\nupright beam, which had been placed at some period as a support for the\r\nold worm-eaten baulk of timber which spanned the roof. To this post a\r\nfigure was tied, so swathed and muffled in the sheets which had been\r\nused to secure it that one could not for the moment tell whether it was\r\nthat of a man or a woman. One towel passed round the throat and was\r\nsecured at the back of the pillar. Another covered the lower part of the\r\nface, and over it two dark eyes -- eyes full of grief and shame and a\r\ndreadful questioning -- stared back at us. In a minute we had torn off\r\nthe gag, unswathed the bonds, and Mrs. Stapleton sank upon the floor in\r\nfront of us. As her beautiful head fell upon her chest I saw the clear\r\nred weal of a whiplash across her neck.\r\n\r\nThe brute! cried Holmes. Here, Lestrade, your brandy-bottle! Put\r\nher in the chair! She has fainted from ill-usage and exhaustion.\r\n\r\nShe opened her eyes again.\r\n\r\nIs he safe? she asked. Has he escaped?\r\n\r\nHe cannot escape us, madam.\r\n\r\nNo, no, I did not mean my husband. Sir Henry? Is he safe?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
