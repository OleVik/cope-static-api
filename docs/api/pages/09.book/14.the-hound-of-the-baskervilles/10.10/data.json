{"attributes":{},"body":"It's dead, whatever it is, said Holmes. We've laid the family\r\nghost once and forever.\r\n\r\nIn mere size and strength it was a terrible creature which was lying\r\nstretched before us. It was not a pure bloodhound and it was not a pure\r\nmastiff; but it appeared to be a combination of the two -- gaunt, savage,\r\nand as large as a small lioness. Even now, in the stillness of death,\r\nthe huge jaws seemed to be dripping with a bluish flame and the small,\r\ndeep-set, cruel eyes were ringed with fire. I placed my hand upon the\r\nglowing muzzle, and as I held them up my own fingers smouldered and\r\ngleamed in the darkness.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus, I said.\r\n\r\nA cunning preparation of it, said Holmes, sniffing at the dead\r\nanimal. There is no smell which might have interfered with his power\r\nof scent. We owe you a deep apology, Sir Henry, for having exposed you\r\nto this fright. I was prepared for a hound, but not for such a creature\r\nas this. And the fog gave us little time to receive him.\r\n\r\nYou have saved my life.\r\n\r\nHaving first endangered it. Are you strong enough to stand?\r\n\r\nGive me another mouthful of that brandy and I shall be ready for\r\nanything. So! Now, if you will help me up. What do you propose to do?\r\n\r\nTo leave you here. You are not fit for further adventures to-night. If\r\nyou will wait, one or other of us will go back with you to the Hall.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
