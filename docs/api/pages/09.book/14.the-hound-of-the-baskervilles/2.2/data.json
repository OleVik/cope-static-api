My friend and I are also ready for emergencies.\r\n\r\nYou're mighty close about this affair, Mr. Holmes. What's the game\r\nnow?\r\n\r\nA waiting game.\r\n\r\nMy word, it does not seem a very cheerful place, said the detective\r\nwith a shiver, glancing round him at the gloomy slopes of the hill and\r\nat the huge lake of fog which lay over the Grimpen Mire. I see the\r\nlights of a house ahead of us.\r\n\r\nThat is Merripit House and the end of our journey. I must request you\r\nto walk on tiptoe and not to talk above a whisper.\r\n\r\nWe moved cautiously along the track as if we were bound for the house,\r\nbut Holmes halted us when we were about two hundred yards from it.\r\n\r\nThis will do, said he. These rocks upon the right make an\r\nadmirable screen.\r\n\r\nWe are to wait here?\r\n\r\nYes, we shall make our little ambush here. Get into this hollow,\r\nLestrade. You have been inside the house, have you not, Watson? Can you\r\ntell the position of the rooms? What are those latticed windows at this\r\nend?\r\n\r\nI think they are the kitchen windows.\r\n\r\nAnd the one beyond, which shines so brightly?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
