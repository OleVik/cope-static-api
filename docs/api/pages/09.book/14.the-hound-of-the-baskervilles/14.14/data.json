{"attributes":{},"body":"Yes.\r\n\r\nAnd the hound?\r\n\r\nIt is dead.\r\n\r\nShe gave a long sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nThank God! Thank God! Oh, this villain! See how he has treated me!\r\nShe shot her arms out from her sleeves, and we saw with horror that they\r\nwere all mottled with bruises. But this is nothing -- nothing! It is my\r\nmind and soul that he has tortured and defiled. I could endure it all,\r\nill-usage, solitude, a life of deception, everything, as long as I could\r\nstill cling to the hope that I had his love, but now I know that in this\r\nalso I have been his dupe and his tool. She broke into passionate\r\nsobbing as she spoke.\r\n\r\nYou bear him no good will, madam, said Holmes. Tell us then where\r\nwe shall find him. If you have ever aided him in evil, help us now and\r\nso atone.\r\n\r\nThere is but one place where he can have fled, she answered. There\r\nis an old tin mine on an island in the heart of the mire. It was there\r\nthat he kept his hound and there also he had made preparations so that\r\nhe might have a refuge. That is where he would fly.\r\n\r\nThe fog-bank lay like white wool against the window. Holmes held the\r\nlamp towards it.\r\n\r\nSee, said he. No one could find his way into the Grimpen Mire\r\nto-night.\r\n\r\nShe laughed and clapped her hands. Her eyes and teeth gleamed with\r\nfierce merriment.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
