{"attributes":{},"body":"This time you may do it with safety. If I had not every confidence in\r\nyour nerve and courage I would not suggest it, but it is essential that\r\nyou should do it.\r\n\r\nThen I will do it.\r\n\r\nAnd as you value your life do not go across the moor in any direction\r\nsave along the straight path which leads from Merripit House to the\r\nGrimpen Road, and is your natural way home.\r\n\r\nI will do just what you say.\r\n\r\nVery good. I should be glad to get away as soon after breakfast as\r\npossible, so as to reach London in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nI was much astounded by this programme, though I remembered that Holmes\r\nhad said to Stapleton on the night before that his visit would terminate\r\nnext day. It had not crossed my mind, however, that he would wish me to\r\ngo with him, nor could I understand how we could both be absent at a\r\nmoment which he himself declared to be critical. There was nothing for\r\nit, however, but implicit obedience; so we bade good-bye to our rueful\r\nfriend, and a couple of hours afterwards we were at the station of\r\nCoombe Tracey and had dispatched the trap upon its return journey. A\r\nsmall boy was waiting upon the platform.\r\n\r\nAny orders, sir?\r\n\r\nYou will take this train to town, Cartwright. The moment you arrive\r\nyou will send a wire to Sir Henry Baskerville, in my name, to say that\r\nif he finds the pocket-book which I have dropped he is to send it by\r\nregistered post to Baker Street.\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
