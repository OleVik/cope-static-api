{"attributes":{},"body":"Not a shadow of one -- only surmise and conjecture. We should be\r\nlaughed out of court if we came with such a story and such evidence.\r\n\r\nThere is Sir Charles's death.\r\n\r\nFound dead without a mark upon him. You and I know that he died of\r\nsheer fright, and we know also what frightened him; but how are we to\r\nget twelve stolid jurymen to know it? What signs are there of a hound?\r\nWhere are the marks of its fangs? Of course we know that a hound does\r\nnot bite a dead body and that Sir Charles was dead before ever the brute\r\novertook him. But we have to prove all this, and we are not in a\r\nposition to do it.\r\n\r\nWell, then, to-night?\r\n\r\nWe are not much better off to-night. Again, there was no direct\r\nconnection between the hound and the man's death. We never saw the\r\nhound. We heard it; but we could not prove that it was running upon this\r\nman's trail. There is a complete absence of motive. No, my dear fellow;\r\nwe must reconcile ourselves to the fact that we have no case at present,\r\nand that it is worth our while to run any risk in order to establish\r\none.\r\n\r\nAnd how do you propose to do so?\r\n\r\nI have great hopes of what Mrs. Laura Lyons may do for us when the\r\nposition of affairs is made clear to her. And I have my own plan as\r\nwell. Sufficient for to-morrow is the evil thereof; but I hope before\r\nthe day is past to have the upper hand at last.\r\n\r\nI could draw nothing further from him, and he walked, lost in thought,\r\nas far as the Baskerville gates.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
