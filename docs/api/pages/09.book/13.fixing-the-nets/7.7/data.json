{"attributes":{},"body":"Dear me! said Holmes, he seems a quiet, meek-mannered man enough,\r\nbut I dare say that there was a lurking devil in his eyes. I had\r\npictured him as a more robust and ruffianly person.\r\n\r\nThere's no doubt about the authenticity, for the name and the date,\r\n1647, are on the back of the canvas.\r\n\r\nHolmes said little more, but the picture of the old roysterer seemed to\r\nhave a fascination for him, and his eyes were continually fixed upon it\r\nduring supper. It was not until later, when Sir Henry had gone to his\r\nroom, that I was able to follow the trend of his thoughts. He led me\r\nback into the banqueting-hall, his bedroom candle in his hand, and he\r\nheld it up against the time-stained portrait on the wall.\r\n\r\nDo you see anything there?\r\n\r\nI looked at the broad plumed hat, the curling love-locks, the white lace\r\ncollar, and the straight, severe face which was framed between them. It\r\nwas not a brutal countenance, but it was prim, hard, and stern, with a\r\nfirm-set, thin-lipped mouth, and a coldly intolerant eye.\r\n\r\nIs it like anyone you know?\r\n\r\nThere is something of Sir Henry about the jaw.\r\n\r\nJust a suggestion, perhaps. But wait an instant! He stood upon a\r\nchair, and, holding up the light in his left hand, he curved his right\r\narm over the broad hat and round the long ringlets.\r\n\r\nGood heavens! I cried, in amazement.\r\n\r\nThe face of Stapleton had sprung out of the canvas.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
