And I have also communicated with my faithful\r\nCartwright, who would certainly have pined away at the door of my hut,\r\nas a dog does at his master's grave, if I had not set his mind at rest\r\nabout my safety.\r\n\r\nWhat is the next move?\r\n\r\nTo see Sir Henry. Ah, here he is!\r\n\r\nGood morning, Holmes, said the baronet. You look like a general\r\nwho is planning a battle with his chief of the staff.\r\n\r\nThat is the exact situation. Watson was asking for orders.\r\n\r\nAnd so do I.\r\n\r\nVery good. You are engaged, as I understand, to dine with our friends\r\nthe Stapletons to-night.\r\n\r\nI hope that you will come also. They are very hospitable people, and I\r\nam sure that they would be very glad to see you.\r\n\r\nI fear that Watson and I must go to London.\r\n\r\nTo London?\r\n\r\nYes, I think that we should be more useful there at the present\r\njuncture.\r\n\r\nThe baronet's face perceptibly lengthened. I hoped that you were\r\ngoing to see me through this business. The Hall and the moor are not\r\nvery pleasant places when one is alone.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow, you must trust me implicitly and do exactly what I\r\ntell you. You can tell your friends that we should have been happy to\r\nhave come with you, but that urgent business\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
