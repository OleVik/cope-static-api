{"attributes":{},"body":"incidents in Godno, in Little Russia, in the year '66, and of course\r\nthere are the Anderson murders in North Carolina, but this case\r\npossesses some features which are entirely its own. Even now we have no\r\nclear case against this very wily man. But I shall be very much\r\nsurprised if it is not clear enough before we go to bed this night.\r\n\r\nThe London express came roaring into the station, and a small, wiry\r\nbulldog of a man had sprung from a first-class carriage. We all three\r\nshook hands, and I saw at once from the reverential way in which\r\nLestrade gazed at my companion that he had learned a good deal since the\r\ndays when they had first worked together.

We have two hours before\r\nwe need think of starting. I think we might employ it in getting some\r\ndinner and then, Lestrade, we will take the London fog out of your\r\nthroat by giving you a breath of the pure night air of Dartmoor. Never\r\nbeen there? Ah, well, I don't suppose you will forget your first\r\nvisit.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
