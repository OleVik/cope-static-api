{"attributes":{},"body":"There is no connection.\r\n\r\nIn that case the coincidence must indeed be an extraordinary one. But\r\nI think that we shall succeed in establishing a connection after all. I\r\nwish to be perfectly frank with you, Mrs. Lyons. We regard this case as\r\none of murder, and the evidence may implicate not only your friend Mr.\r\nStapleton, but his wife as well. The lady sprang from her chair.\r\n\r\nHis wife! she cried.\r\n\r\nThe fact is no longer a secret. The person who has passed for his\r\nsister is really his wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lyons had resumed her seat. Her hands were grasping the arms of her\r\nchair, and I saw that the pink nails had turned white with the pressure\r\nof her grip.\r\n\r\nHis wife! she said again. His wife! He is not a married man.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nProve it to me! Prove it to me! And if you can do so  -- ! The fierce\r\nflash of her eyes said more than any words.\r\n\r\nI have come prepared to do so, said Holmes, drawing several papers\r\nfrom his pocket. Here is a photograph of the couple taken in York four\r\nyears ago. It is indorsed 'Mr. and Mrs. Vandeleur,' but you will have\r\nno difficulty in recognizing him, and her also, if you know her by\r\nsight. Here are three written descriptions by trustworthy witnesses of\r\nMr. and Mrs. Vandeleur, who at that time kept St. Oliver's private\r\nschool. Read them and see if you can doubt the identity of these\r\npeople.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
