{"attributes":{},"body":"I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend in\r\nthose hours of intense mental concentration during which he weighed\r\nevery particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories, balanced\r\none against the other, and made up his mind as to which points were\r\nessential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day at my club and\r\ndid not return to Baker Street until evening. It was nearly nine\r\no'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once more.\r\n\r\nMy first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken out,\r\nfor the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp upon\r\nthe table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears were set at\r\nrest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco which took me\r\nby the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I had a vague vision\r\nof Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an armchair with his black\r\nclay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of paper lay around him.\r\n\r\nCaught cold, Watson? said he.\r\n\r\nNo, it's this poisonous atmosphere.\r\n\r\nI suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it.\r\n\r\nThick! It is intolerable.\r\n\r\nOpen the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I\r\nperceive.\r\n\r\nMy dear Holmes!\r\n\r\nAm I right?\r\n\r\nCertainly, but how?\r\n\r\nHe laughed at my bewildered expression.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
