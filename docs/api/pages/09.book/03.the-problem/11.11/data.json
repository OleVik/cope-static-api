{"attributes":{},"body":"perceive, upon the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is\r\nthe hamlet of Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his\r\nheadquarters. Within a radius of five miles there are, as you see, only\r\na very few scattered dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned\r\nin the narrative. There is a house indicated here which may be the\r\nresidence of the naturalist -- Stapleton, if I remember right, was his\r\nname. Here are two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then\r\nfourteen miles away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and\r\naround these scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This,\r\nthen, is the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we\r\nmay help to play it again.\r\n\r\nIt must be a wild place.\r\n\r\nYes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a\r\nhand in the affairs of men \\-\\- -- \r\n\r\nThen you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation.\r\n\r\nThe devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There are\r\ntwo questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether any crime\r\nhas been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime and how was\r\nit committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should be correct,\r\nand we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws of Nature,\r\nthere is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to exhaust all\r\nother hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I think we'll shut\r\nthat window again, if you don't mind. It is a singular thing, but I\r\nfind that a concentrated atmosphere helps a concentration of thought. I\r\nhave not pushed it to the length of getting into a box to think, but\r\nthat is the logical outcome of my convictions. Have you turned the case\r\nover in your mind?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
