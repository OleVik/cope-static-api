{"attributes":{},"body":"I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a thrill\r\nin the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply moved by\r\nthat which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his excitement and his\r\neyes had the hard, dry glitter which shot from them when he was keenly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\nYou saw this?\r\n\r\nAs clearly as I see you.\r\n\r\nAnd you said nothing?\r\n\r\nWhat was the use?\r\n\r\nHow was it that no one else saw it?\r\n\r\nThe marks were some twenty yards from the body and no one gave them a\r\nthought. I don't suppose I should have done so had I not known this\r\nlegend.\r\n\r\nThere are many sheep-dogs on the moor?\r\n\r\nNo doubt, but this was no sheep-dog.\r\n\r\nYou say it was large?\r\n\r\nEnormous.\r\n\r\nBut it had not approached the body?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWhat sort of night was it?'\r\n\r\nDamp and raw.\r\n\r\nBut not actually raining?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
