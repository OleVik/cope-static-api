{"attributes":{},"body":"What is the Alley like?\r\n\r\nThere are two lines of old yew hedge, twelve feet high and\r\nimpenetrable. The walk in the centre is about eight feet across.\r\n\r\nIs there anything between the hedges and the walk?\r\n\r\nYes, there is a strip of grass about six feet broad on either side.\r\n\r\nI understand that the yew hedge is penetrated at one point by a\r\ngate?\r\n\r\nYes, the wicket-gate which leads on to the moor.\r\n\r\nIs there any other opening?\r\n\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nSo that to reach the Yew Alley one either has to come down it from the\r\nhouse or else to enter it by the moor-gate?\r\n\r\nThere is an exit through a summer-house at the far end.\r\n\r\nHad Sir Charles reached this?\r\n\r\nNo; he lay about fifty yards from it.\r\n\r\nNow, tell me, Dr. Mortimer -- and this is important -- the marks which\r\nyou saw were on the path and not on the grass?\r\n\r\nNo marks could show on the grass.\r\n\r\nWere they on the same side of the path as the moor-gate?\r\n\r\nYes; they were on the edge of the path on the same side as the\r\nmoor-gate.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
