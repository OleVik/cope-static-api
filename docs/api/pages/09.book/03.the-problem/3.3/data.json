{"attributes":{},"body":"You interest me exceedingly. Another point. Was the wicket-gate\r\nclosed?\r\n\r\nClosed and padlocked.\r\n\r\nHow high was it?\r\n\r\nAbout four feet high.\r\n\r\nThen anyone could have got over it?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nAnd what marks did you see by the wicket-gate?\r\n\r\nNone in particular.\r\n\r\nGood heaven! Did no one examine?\r\n\r\nYes, I examined myself.\r\n\r\nAnd found nothing?\r\n\r\nIt was all very confused. Sir Charles had evidently stood there for\r\nfive or ten minutes.\r\n\r\nHow do you know that?\r\n\r\nBecause the ash had twice dropped from his cigar.\r\n\r\nExcellent! This is a colleague, Watson, after our own heart. But the\r\nmarks?\r\n\r\nHe had left his own marks all over that small patch of gravel. I could\r\ndiscern no others.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes struck his hand against his knee with an impatient\r\ngesture.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
