{"attributes":{},"body":"discussing the comparative anatomy of the Bushman and the Hottentot.\r\n\r\nWithin the last few months it became increasingly plain to me that Sir\r\nCharles's nervous system was strained to the breaking point. He had\r\ntaken this legend which I have read you exceedingly to heart -- so much\r\nso that, although he would walk in his own grounds, nothing would induce\r\nhim to go out upon the moor at night. Incredible as it may appear to\r\nyou, Mr. Holmes, he was honestly convinced that a dreadful fate overhung\r\nhis family, and certainly the records which he was able to give of his\r\nancestors were not encouraging. The idea of some ghastly presence\r\nconstantly haunted him, and on more than one occasion he has asked me\r\nwhether I had on my medical journeys at night ever seen any strange\r\ncreature or heard the baying of a hound. The latter question he put to\r\nme several times, and always with a voice which vibrated with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nI can well remember driving up to his house in the evening some three\r\nweeks before the fatal event. He chanced to be at his hall door. I had\r\ndescended from my gig and was standing in front of him, when I saw his\r\neyes fix themselves over my shoulder, and stare past me with an\r\nexpression of the most dreadful horror. I whisked round and had just\r\ntime to catch a glimpse of something which I took to be a large black\r\ncalf passing at the head of the drive. So excited and alarmed was he\r\nthat I was compelled to go down to the spot where the animal had been\r\nand look around for it. It was gone, however, and the incident appeared\r\nto make the worst impression upon his mind. I stayed with him all the\r\nevening, and it was on that occasion, to explain the emotion which he\r\nhad shown, that he confided to my keeping that narrative which I read to\r\nyou when first I came.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
