{"attributes":{},"body":"interest. I had observed some newspaper comment at the time, but I was\r\nexceedingly preoccupied by that little affair of the Vatican cameos, and\r\nin my anxiety to oblige the Pope I lost touch with several interesting\r\nEnglish cases. This article, you say, contains all the public facts?\r\n\r\nIt does.\r\n\r\nThen let me have the private ones. He leaned back, put his\r\nfinger-tips together, and assumed his most impassive and judicial\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nIn doing so, said Dr. Mortimer, who had begun to show signs of some\r\nstrong emotion, I am telling that which I have not confided to anyone.\r\nMy motive for withholding it from the coroner's inquiry is that a man\r\nof science shrinks from placing himself in the public position of\r\nseeming to indorse a popular superstition. I had the further motive that\r\nBaskerville Hall, as the paper says, would certainly remain untenanted\r\nif anything were done to increase its already rather grim reputation.\r\nFor both these reasons I thought that I was justified in telling rather\r\nless than I knew, since no practical good could result from it, but with\r\nyou there is no reason why I should not be perfectly frank.\r\n\r\nThe moor is very sparsely inhabited, and those who live near each\r\nother are thrown very much together. For this reason I saw a good deal\r\nof Sir Charles Baskerville. With the exception of Mr. Frankland, of\r\nLafter Hall, and Mr. Stapleton, the naturalist, there are no other men\r\nof education within many miles. Sir Charles was a retiring man, but the\r\nchance of his illness brought us together, and a community of interests\r\nin science kept us so. He had brought back much scientific information\r\nfrom South Africa, and many a charming evening we have spent together\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
