{"attributes":{},"body":"might find ourselves at the end of all our difficulties. To this one\r\npurpose I must now devote all my energies.\r\n\r\nMy first impulse was to tell Sir Henry all my plans. My second and\r\nwisest one is to play my own game and speak as little as possible to\r\nanyone. He is silent and distrait. His nerves have been strangely shaken\r\nby that sound upon the moor. I will say nothing to add to his anxieties,\r\nbut I will take my own steps to attain my own end.\r\n\r\nWe had a small scene this morning after breakfast. Barrymore asked leave\r\nto speak with Sir Henry, and they were closeted in his study some little\r\ntime. Sitting in the billiard-room I more than once heard the sound of\r\nvoices raised, and I had a pretty good idea what the point was which was\r\nunder discussion. After a time the baronet opened his door and called\r\nfor me.\r\n\r\nBarrymore considers that he has a grievance, he said. He thinks\r\nthat it was unfair on our part to hunt his brother-in-law down when he,\r\nof his own free will, had told us the secret.\r\n\r\nThe butler was standing very pale but very collected before us.\r\n\r\nI may have spoken too warmly, sir, said he, and if I have, I am\r\nsure that I beg your pardon. At the same time, I was very much surprised\r\nwhen I heard you two gentlemen come back this morning and learned that\r\nyou had been chasing Selden. The poor fellow has enough to fight against\r\nwithout my putting more upon his track.\r\n\r\nIf you had told us of your own free will it would have been a\r\ndifferent thing, said the baronet, you only told us, or rather your\r\nwife only told us, when it was forced from you and you could not help\r\nyourself.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
