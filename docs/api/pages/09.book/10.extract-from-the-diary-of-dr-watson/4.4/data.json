{"attributes":{},"body":"I didn't think you would have taken advantage of it, Sir\r\nHenry -- indeed I didn't.\r\n\r\nThe man is a public danger. There are lonely houses scattered over the\r\nmoor, and he is a fellow who would stick at nothing. You only want to\r\nget a glimpse of his face to see that. Look at Mr. Stapleton's house,\r\nfor example, with no one but himself to defend it. There's no safety\r\nfor anyone until he is under lock and key.\r\n\r\nHe'll break into no house, sir. I give you my solemn word upon that.\r\nBut he will never trouble anyone in this country again. I assure you,\r\nSir Henry, that in a very few days the necessary arrangements will have\r\nbeen made and he will be on his way to South America. For God's sake,\r\nsir, I beg of you not to let the police know that he is still on the\r\nmoor. They have given up the chase there, and he can lie quiet until the\r\nship is ready for him. You can't tell on him without getting my wife\r\nand me into trouble. I beg you, sir, to say nothing to the police.\r\n\r\nWhat do you say, Watson?\r\n\r\nI shrugged my shoulders. If he were safely out of the country it would\r\nrelieve the tax-payer of a burden.\r\n\r\nBut how about the chance of his holding someone up before he goes?\r\n\r\nHe would not do anything so mad, sir. We have provided him with all\r\nthat he can want. To commit a crime would be to show where he was\r\nhiding.\r\n\r\nThat is true, said Sir Henry. Well, Barrymore  -- \r\n","bodyBegin":1}
