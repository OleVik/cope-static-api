{"attributes":{},"body":"So far I have been able to quote from the reports which I have forwarded\r\nduring these early days to Sherlock Holmes. Now, however, I have arrived\r\nat a point in my narrative where I am compelled to abandon this method\r\nand to trust once more to my recollections, aided by the diary which I\r\nkept at the time. A few extracts from the latter will carry me on to\r\nthose scenes which are indelibly fixed in every detail upon my memory. I\r\nproceed, then, from the morning which followed our abortive chase of the\r\nconvict and our other strange experiences upon the moor.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER 16TH. -- A dull and foggy day with a drizzle of rain. The house\r\nis banked in with rolling clouds, which rise now and then to show the\r\ndreary curves of the moor, with thin, silver veins upon the sides of the\r\nhills, and the distant boulders gleaming where the light strikes upon\r\ntheir wet faces. It is melancholy outside and in. The baronet is in a\r\nblack reaction after the excitements of the night. I am conscious myself\r\nof a weight at my heart and a feeling of impending danger -- ever present\r\ndanger, which is the more terrible because I am unable to define it.\r\n\r\nAnd have I not cause for such a feeling? Consider the long sequence of\r\nincidents which have all pointed to some sinister influence which is at\r\nwork around us. There is the death of the last occupant of the Hall,\r\nfulfilling so exactly the conditions of the family legend, and there are\r\nthe repeated reports from peasants of the appearance of a strange\r\ncreature upon the moor. Twice I have with my own ears heard the sound\r\nwhich resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is incredible,\r\nimpossible, that it should really be outside the ordinary laws of\r\nnature. A spectral hound which leaves material footmarks and fills the\r\nair with its howling is surely not to be thought of.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
