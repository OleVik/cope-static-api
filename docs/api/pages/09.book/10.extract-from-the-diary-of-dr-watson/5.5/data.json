{"attributes":{},"body":"God bless you, sir, and thank you from my heart! It would have killed\r\nmy poor wife had he been taken again.\r\n\r\nI guess we are aiding and abetting a felony, Watson? But, after what\r\nwe have heard I don't feel as if I could give the man up, so there is\r\nan end of it. All right, Barrymore, you can go.\r\n\r\nWith a few broken words of gratitude the man turned, but he hesitated\r\nand then came back.\r\n\r\nYou've been so kind to us, sir, that I should like to do the best I\r\ncan for you in return. I know something, Sir Henry, and perhaps I should\r\nhave said it before, but it was long after the inquest that I found it\r\nout. I've never breathed a word about it yet to mortal man. It's about\r\npoor Sir Charles's death.\r\n\r\nThe baronet and I were both upon our feet. Do you know how he died?\r\n\r\nNo, sir, I don't know that.\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nI know why he was at the gate at that hour. It was to meet a woman.\r\n\r\nTo meet a woman! He?\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nAnd the woman's name?\r\n\r\nI can't give you the name, sir, but I can give you the initials. Her\r\ninitials were L. L.\r\n\r\nHow do you know this, Barrymore?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
