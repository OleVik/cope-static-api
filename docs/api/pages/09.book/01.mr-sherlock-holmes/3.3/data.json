There are certainly one or two\r\nindications upon the stick. It gives us the basis for several\r\ndeductions.\r\n\r\nHas anything escaped me? I asked with some self-importance. I\r\ntrust that there is nothing of consequence which I have overlooked?\r\n\r\nI am afraid, my dear Watson, that most of your conclusions were\r\nerroneous. When I said that you stimulated me I meant, to be frank, that\r\nin noting your fallacies I was occasionally guided towards the truth.\r\nNot that you are entirely wrong in this instance. The man is certainly a\r\ncountry practitioner. And he walks a good deal.\r\n\r\nThen I was right.\r\n\r\nTo that extent.\r\n\r\nBut that was all.\r\n\r\nNo, no, my dear Watson, not all -- by no means all. I would suggest,\r\nfor example, that a presentation to a doctor is more likely to come from\r\na hospital than from a hunt, and that when the initials 'C.C.' are\r\nplaced before that hospital the words 'Charing Cross' very naturally\r\nsuggest themselves.\r\n\r\nYou may be right.\r\n\r\nThe probability lies in that direction. And if we take this as a\r\nworking hypothesis we have a fresh basis from which to start our\r\nconstruction of this unknown visitor.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
