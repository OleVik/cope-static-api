{"attributes":{},"body":"fissure? A cast of your skull, sir, until the original is available,\r\nwould be an ornament to any anthropological museum. It is not my\r\nintention to be fulsome, but I confess that I covet your skull.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes waved our strange visitor into a chair.

Recognizing, as I do, that you\r\nare the second highest expert in Europe \\-\\-\\-\\- -- \r\n\r\nIndeed, sir! May I inquire who has the honour to be the first? asked\r\nHolmes with some asperity.\r\n\r\nTo the man of precisely scientific mind the work of Monsieur Bertillon\r\nmust always appeal strongly.\r\n\r\nThen had you not better consult him?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
