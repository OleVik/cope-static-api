{"attributes":{},"body":"Well, then, supposing that 'C.C.H.' does stand for 'Charing Cross\r\nHospital,' what further inferences may we draw?\r\n\r\nDo none suggest themselves? You know my methods. Apply them!\r\n\r\nI can only think of the obvious conclusion that the man has practised\r\nin town before going to the country.\r\n\r\nI think that we might venture a little farther than this. Look at it\r\nin this light. On what occasion would it be most probable that such a\r\npresentation would be made? When would his friends unite to give him a\r\npledge of their good will? Obviously at the moment when Dr. Mortimer\r\nwithdrew from the service of the hospital in order to start in practice\r\nfor himself. We know there has been a presentation. We believe there has\r\nbeen a change from a town hospital to a country practice. Is it, then,\r\nstretching our inference too far to say that the presentation was on the\r\noccasion of the change?\r\n\r\nIt certainly seems probable.\r\n\r\nNow, you will observe that he could not have been on the staff of the\r\nhospital, since only a man well-established in a London practice could\r\nhold such a position, and such a one would not drift into the country.\r\nWhat was he, then? If he was in the hospital and yet not on the staff he\r\ncould only have been a house-surgeon or a house-physician -- little more\r\nthan a senior student. And he left five years ago -- the date is on the\r\nstick. So your grave, middle-aged family practitioner vanishes into thin\r\nair, my dear Watson, and there emerges a young fellow under thirty,\r\namiable, unambitious, absent-minded, and the possessor of a favourite\r\ndog, which I should describe roughly as being larger than a terrier and\r\nsmaller than a mastiff.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
