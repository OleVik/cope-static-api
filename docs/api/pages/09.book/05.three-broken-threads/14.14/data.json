We followed their cab until it pulled up somewhere\r\nnear here.\r\n\r\nThis very door, said Holmes.\r\n\r\nWell, I couldn't be sure of that, but I dare say my fare knew all\r\nabout it. We pulled up half-way down the street and waited an hour and a\r\nhalf. Then the two gentlemen passed us, walking, and we followed down\r\nBaker Street and along \\-\\- -- \r\n\r\nI know, said Holmes.\r\n\r\nUntil we got three-quarters down Regent Street. Then my gentleman\r\nthrew up the trap, and he cried that I should drive right away to\r\nWaterloo Station as hard as I could go. I whipped up the mare and we\r\nwere there under the ten minutes. Then he paid up his two guineas, like\r\na good one, and away he went into the station. Only just as he was\r\nleaving he turned round and he said: 'It might interest you to know\r\nthat you have been driving Mr. Sherlock Holmes.' That's how I come to\r\nknow the name.\r\n\r\nI see.

Well, he wasn't altogether such an\r\neasy gentleman to describe. I'd put him at forty years of age, and he\r\nwas of a middle height, two or three inches shorter than you, sir. He\r\nwas dressed like a toff, and he had a black beard, cut square at the\r\nend, and a pale face. I don't know as I could say more than that.\r\n\r\nColour of his eyes?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
