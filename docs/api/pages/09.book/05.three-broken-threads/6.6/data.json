{"attributes":{},"body":"That, unfortunately, is what I cannot tell you. Have you among your\r\nneighbours or acquaintances on Dartmoor any man with a black, full\r\nbeard?\r\n\r\nNo -- or, let me see -- why, yes. Barrymore, Sir Charles's butler, is a\r\nman with a full, black beard.\r\n\r\nHa! Where is Barrymore?\r\n\r\nHe is in charge of the Hall.\r\n\r\nWe had best ascertain if he is really there, or if by any possibility\r\nhe might be in London.\r\n\r\nHow can you do that?\r\n\r\nGive me a telegraph form. 'Is all ready for Sir Henry?' That will\r\ndo. Address to Mr. Barrymore, Baskerville Hall. What is the nearest\r\ntelegraph-office? Grimpen. Very good, we will send a second wire to the\r\npostmaster, Grimpen: 'Telegram to Mr. Barrymore to be delivered into\r\nhis own hand. If absent, please return wire to Sir Henry Baskerville,\r\nNorthumberland Hotel.' That should let us know before evening whether\r\nBarrymore is at his post in Devonshire or not.\r\n\r\nThat's so, said Baskerville. By the way, Dr. Mortimer, who is\r\nthis Barrymore, anyhow?\r\n\r\nHe is the son of the old caretaker, who is dead. They have looked\r\nafter the Hall for four generations now. So far as I know, he and his\r\nwife are as respectable a couple as any in the county.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, said Baskerville, it's clear enough that so\r\nlong as there are none of the family at the Hall these people have a\r\nmighty fine home and nothing to do.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
