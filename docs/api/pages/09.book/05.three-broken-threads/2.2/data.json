{"attributes":{},"body":"She is an invalid lady, sir. Her husband was once mayor of Gloucester.\r\nShe always comes to us when she is in town.\r\n\r\nThank you; I am afraid I cannot claim her acquaintance. We have\r\nestablished a most important fact by these questions, Watson, he\r\ncontinued in a low voice as we went upstairs together. We know now\r\nthat the people who are so interested in our friend have not settled\r\ndown in his own hotel. That means that while they are, as we have seen,\r\nvery anxious to watch him, they are equally anxious that he should not\r\nsee them. Now, this is a most suggestive fact.\r\n\r\nWhat does it suggest?\r\n\r\nIt suggests -- halloa, my dear fellow, what on earth is the matter?\r\n\r\nAs we came round the top of the stairs we had run up against Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville himself. His face was flushed with anger, and he held an old\r\nand dusty boot in one of his hands. So furious was he that he was hardly\r\narticulate, and when he did speak it was in a much broader and more\r\nWestern dialect than any which we had heard from him in the morning.\r\n\r\nSeems to me they are playing me for a sucker in this hotel, he\r\ncried. They'll find they've started in to monkey with the wrong man\r\nunless they are careful. By thunder, if that chap can't find my missing\r\nboot there will be trouble. I can take a joke with the best, Mr. Holmes,\r\nbut they've got a bit over the mark this time.\r\n\r\nStill looking for your boot?\r\n\r\nYes, sir, and mean to find it.\r\n\r\nBut, surely, you said that it was a new brown boot?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
