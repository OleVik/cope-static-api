{"attributes":{},"body":"The German was sent for but professed to know nothing of the matter, nor\r\ncould any inquiry clear it up. Another item had been added to that\r\nconstant and apparently purposeless series of small mysteries which had\r\nsucceeded each other so rapidly. Setting aside the whole grim story of\r\nSir Charles's death, we had a line of inexplicable incidents all within\r\nthe limits of two days, which included the receipt of the printed\r\nletter, the black-bearded spy in the hansom, the loss of the new brown\r\nboot, the loss of the old black boot, and now the return of the new\r\nbrown boot. Holmes sat in silence in the cab as we drove back to Baker\r\nStreet, and I knew from his drawn brows and keen face that his mind,\r\nlike my own, was busy in endeavouring to frame some scheme into which\r\nall these strange and apparently disconnected episodes could be fitted.\r\nAll afternoon and late into the evening he sat lost in tobacco and\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nJust before dinner two telegrams were handed in. The first ran: -- \r\n\r\nHave just heard that Barrymore is at the Hall. -- BASKERVILLE. The\r\nsecond: -- \r\n\r\nVisited twenty-three hotels as directed, but sorry, to report unable\r\nto trace cut sheet of Times. -- CARTWRIGHT.\r\n\r\nThere go two of my threads, Watson. There is nothing more stimulating\r\nthan a case where everything goes against you. We must cast round for\r\nanother scent.\r\n\r\nWe have still the cabman who drove the spy.\r\n\r\nExactly. I have wired to get his name and address from the Official\r\nRegistry. I should not be surprised if this were an answer to my\r\nquestion.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
