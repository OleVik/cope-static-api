{"attributes":{},"body":"The ring at the bell proved to be something even more satisfactory than\r\nan answer, however, for the door opened and a rough-looking fellow\r\nentered who was evidently the man himself.\r\n\r\nI got a message from the head office that a gent at this address had\r\nbeen inquiring for 2704, said he. I've driven my cab this seven\r\nyears and never a word of complaint. I came here straight from the Yard\r\nto ask you to your face what you had against me.\r\n\r\nI have nothing in the world against you, my good man, said Holmes.\r\nOn the contrary, I have half a sovereign for you if you will give me a\r\nclear answer to my questions.\r\n\r\nWell, I've had a good day and no mistake, said the cabman, with a\r\ngrin. What was it you wanted to ask, sir?\r\n\r\nFirst of all your name and address, in case I want you again.\r\n\r\nJohn Clayton, 3 Turpey Street, the Borough. My cab is out of\r\nShipley's Yard, near Waterloo Station.\r\n\r\nSherlock Holmes made a note of it.\r\n\r\nNow, Clayton, tell me all about the fare who came and watched this\r\nhouse at ten o'clock this morning and afterwards followed the two\r\ngentlemen down Regent Street.\r\n\r\nThe man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. Why, there's no\r\ngood my telling you things, for you seem to know as much as I do\r\nalready, said he. The truth is that the gentleman told me that he\r\nwas a detective and that I was to say nothing about him to anyone.\r\n\r\nMy good fellow, this is a very serious business, and you may find\r\nyourself in a pretty bad position if you try to hide anything\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
