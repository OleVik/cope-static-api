{"attributes":{},"body":"matter as I do. If you will come down to Baskerville Hall and see me\r\nthrough I'll never forget it.\r\n\r\nThe promise of adventure had always a fascination for me, and I was\r\ncomplimented by the words of Holmes and by the eagerness with which the\r\nbaronet hailed me as a companion.\r\n\r\nI will come, with pleasure, said I. I do not know how I could\r\nemploy my time better.\r\n\r\nAnd you will report very carefully to me, said Holmes. When a\r\ncrisis comes, as it will do, I will direct how you shall act. I suppose\r\nthat by Saturday all might be ready?\r\n\r\nWould that suit Dr. Watson?\r\n\r\nPerfectly.\r\n\r\nThen on Saturday, unless you hear to the contrary, we shall meet at\r\nthe 10:30 train from Paddington.\r\n\r\nWe had risen to depart when Baskerville gave a cry, of triumph, and\r\ndiving into one of the corners of the room he drew a brown boot from\r\nunder a cabinet.\r\n\r\nMy missing boot! he cried.\r\n\r\nMay all our difficulties vanish as easily! said Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nBut it is a very singular thing, Dr. Mortimer remarked. I searched\r\nthis room carefully before lunch.\r\n\r\nAnd so did I, said Baskerville. Every inch of it.\r\n\r\nThere was certainly no boot in it then.\r\n\r\nIn that case the waiter must have placed it there while we were\r\nlunching.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
