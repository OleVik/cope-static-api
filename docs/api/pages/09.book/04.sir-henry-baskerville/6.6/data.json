{"attributes":{},"body":"negro and your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most\r\nelementary branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though\r\nI confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury\r\nwith the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely\r\ndistinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else. As\r\nit was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should find the\r\nwords in yesterday's issue.\r\n\r\nSo far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes, said Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville, someone cut out this message with a scissors -- \r\n\r\nNail-scissors, said Holmes. You can see that it was a very\r\nshort-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over\r\n'keep away.'\r\n\r\nThat is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of\r\nshort-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste -- \r\n\r\nGum, said Holmes.\r\n\r\nWith gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'\r\nshould have been written?\r\n\r\nBecause he could not find it in print. The other words were all simple\r\nand might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less common.\r\n\r\nWhy, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else in\r\nthis message, Mr. Holmes?\r\n\r\nThere are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been\r\ntaken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in rough\r\ncharacters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in any hands\r\nbut those of the highly educated.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
