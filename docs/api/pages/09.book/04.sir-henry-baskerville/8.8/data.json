Yes, I have very little hesitation in saying that could\r\nwe examine the waste-paper baskets of the hotels around Charing Cross\r\nuntil we found the remains of the mutilated Times leader we could lay\r\nour hands straight upon the person who sent this singular message.\r\nHalloa! Halloa! What's this?\r\n\r\nHe was carefully examining the foolscap, upon which the words were\r\npasted, holding it only an inch or two from his eyes.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\nNothing, said he, throwing it down. It is a blank half-sheet of\r\npaper, without even a water-mark upon it.
