{"attributes":{},"body":"It seems a singularly useless thing to steal, said Sherlock Holmes.\r\nI confess that I share Dr. Mortimer's belief that it will not be long\r\nbefore the missing boot is found.\r\n\r\nAnd, now, gentlemen, said the baronet with decision, it seems to\r\nme that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It is\r\ntime that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what we\r\nare all driving at.\r\n\r\nYour request is a very reasonable one, Holmes answered. Dr.\r\nMortimer, I think you could not do better than to tell your story as you\r\ntold it to us.\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, our scientific friend drew his papers from his pocket,\r\nand presented the whole case as he had done upon the morning before. Sir\r\nHenry Baskerville listened with the deepest attention, and with an\r\noccasional exclamation of surprise.\r\n\r\nWell, I seem to have come into an inheritance with a vengeance, said\r\nhe when the long narrative was finished. Of course, I've heard of the\r\nhound ever since I was in the nursery. It's the pet story of the\r\nfamily, though I never thought of taking it seriously before. But as to\r\nmy uncle's death -- well, it all seems boiling up in my head, and I\r\ncan't get it clear yet. You don't seem quite to have made up your mind\r\nwhether it's a case for a policeman or a clergyman.\r\n\r\nPrecisely.\r\n\r\nAnd now there's this affair of the letter to me at the hotel. I\r\nsuppose that fits into its place.\r\n\r\nIt seems to show that someone knows more than we do about what goes on\r\nupon the moor, said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
