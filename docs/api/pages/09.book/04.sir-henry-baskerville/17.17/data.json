{"attributes":{},"body":"A lad of fourteen, with a bright, keen face, had obeyed the summons of\r\nthe manager. He stood now gazing with great reverence at the famous\r\ndetective.\r\n\r\nLet me have the Hotel Directory, said Holmes. Thank you! Now,\r\nCartwright, there are the names of twenty-three hotels here, all in the\r\nimmediate neighbourhood of Charing Cross. Do you see?\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nYou will visit each of these in turn.\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nYou will begin in each case by giving the outside porter one shilling.\r\nHere are twenty-three shillings.\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nYou will tell him that you want to see the waste-paper of yesterday.\r\nYou will say that an important telegram has miscarried and that you are\r\nlooking for it. You understand?\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nBut what you are really looking for is the centre page of the Times\r\nwith some holes cut in it with scissors. Here is a copy of the Times. It\r\nis this page. You could easily recognize it, could you not?\r\n\r\nYes, sir.\r\n\r\nIn each case the outside porter will send for the hall porter, to whom\r\nalso you will give a shilling. Here are twenty-three shillings. You will\r\nthen learn in possibly twenty cases out of the twenty-three that the\r\nwaste of the day before has been burned\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
