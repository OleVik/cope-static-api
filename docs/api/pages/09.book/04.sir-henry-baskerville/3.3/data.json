{"attributes":{},"body":"Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel? asked\r\nHolmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.\r\n\r\nNo one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\nBut Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?\r\n\r\nNo, I had been staying with a friend, said the doctor. There was\r\nno possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel.\r\n\r\nHum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements.\r\nOut of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded into\r\nfour. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the middle\r\nof it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of pasting\r\nprinted words upon it. It ran: As you value your life or your reason\r\nkeep away from the moor. The word moor only was printed in ink.\r\n\r\nNow, said Sir Henry Baskerville, perhaps you will tell me, Mr.\r\nHolmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that takes\r\nso much interest in my affairs?\r\n\r\nWhat do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is\r\nnothing supernatural about this, at any rate?\r\n\r\nNo, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced\r\nthat the business is supernatural.\r\n\r\nWhat business? asked Sir Henry sharply. It seems to me that all\r\nyou gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs.\r\n\r\nYou shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry. I\r\npromise you that, said Sherlock Holmes. We will confine ourselves\r\nfor the present with your permission to this\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
