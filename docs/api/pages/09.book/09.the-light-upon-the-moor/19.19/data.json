{"attributes":{},"body":"think that I am a coward, Watson, but that sound seemed to freeze my\r\nvery blood. Feel my hand!\r\n\r\nIt was as cold as a block of marble.\r\n\r\nYou'll be all right to-morrow.\r\n\r\nI don't think I'll get that cry out of my head. What do you advise\r\nthat we do now?\r\n\r\nShall we turn back?\r\n\r\nNo, by thunder; we have come out to get our man, and we will do it. We\r\nafter the convict, and a hell-hound, as likely as not, after us. Come\r\non! We'll see it through if all the fiends of the pit were loose upon\r\nthe moor.\r\n\r\nWe stumbled slowly along in the darkness, with the black loom of the\r\ncraggy hills around us, and the yellow speck of light burning steadily\r\nin front. There is nothing so deceptive as the distance of a light upon\r\na pitch-dark night, and sometimes the glimmer seemed to be far away upon\r\nthe horizon and sometimes it might have been within a few yards of us.\r\nBut at last we could see whence it came, and then we knew that we were\r\nindeed very close. A guttering candle was stuck in a crevice of the\r\nrocks which flanked it on each side so as to keep the wind from it and\r\nalso to prevent it from being visible, save in the direction of\r\nBaskerville Hall. A boulder of granite concealed our approach, and\r\ncrouching behind it we gazed over it at the signal light. It was strange\r\nto see this single candle burning there in the middle of the moor, with\r\nno sign of life near it -- just the one straight yellow flame and the\r\ngleam of the rock on each side of it.\r\n\r\nWhat shall we do now? whispered Sir Henry.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
