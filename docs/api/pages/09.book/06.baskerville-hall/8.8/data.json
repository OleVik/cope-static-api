{"attributes":{},"body":"was a new building, half constructed, the first fruit of Sir Charles's\r\nSouth African gold.\r\n\r\nThrough the gateway we passed into the avenue, where the wheels were\r\nagain hushed amid the leaves, and the old trees shot their branches in a\r\nsombre tunnel over our heads. Baskerville shuddered as he looked up the\r\nlong, dark drive to where the house glimmered like a ghost at the\r\nfarther end.\r\n\r\nWas it here? he asked in a low voice.\r\n\r\nNo, no, the Yew Alley is on the other side.\r\n\r\nThe young heir glanced round with a gloomy face.\r\n\r\nIt's no wonder my uncle felt as if trouble were coming on him in such\r\na place as this, said he. It's enough to scare any man. I'll have\r\na row of electric lamps up here inside of six months, and you won't\r\nknow it again, with a thousand candle-power Swan and Edison right here\r\nin front of the hall door.\r\n\r\nThe avenue opened into a broad expanse of turf, and the house lay before\r\nus. In the fading light I could see that the centre was a heavy block of\r\nbuilding from which a porch projected. The whole front was draped in\r\nivy, with a patch clipped bare here and there where a window or a\r\ncoat-of-arms broke through the dark veil.\r\n\r\n\\> From this central block rose the twin towers, ancient, crenelated,\r\nand pierced with many loopholes. To right and left of the turrets were\r\nmore modern wings of black granite. A dull light shone through heavy\r\nmullioned windows, and from the high chimneys which rose from the steep,\r\nhigh-angled roof there sprang a single black column of smoke.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
