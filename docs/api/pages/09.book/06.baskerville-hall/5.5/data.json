{"attributes":{},"body":"The train pulled up at a small wayside station and we all descended.\r\nOutside, beyond the low, white fence, a wagonette with a pair of cobs\r\nwas waiting. Our coming was evidently a great event, for station-master\r\nand porters clustered round us to carry out our luggage. It was a sweet,\r\nsimple country spot, but I was surprised to observe that by the gate\r\nthere stood two soldierly men in dark uniforms, who leaned upon their\r\nshort rifles and glanced keenly at us as we passed. The coachman, a\r\nhard-faced, gnarled little fellow, saluted Sir Henry Baskerville, and in\r\na few minutes we were flying swiftly down the broad, white road. Rolling\r\npasture lands curved upward on either side of us, and old gabled houses\r\npeeped out from amid the thick green foliage, but behind the peaceful\r\nand sunlit country-side there rose ever, dark against the evening sky,\r\nthe long, gloomy curve of the moor, broken by the jagged and sinister\r\nhills.\r\n\r\nThe wagonette swung round into a side road, and we curved upward through\r\ndeep lanes worn by centuries of wheels, high banks on either side, heavy\r\nwith dripping moss and fleshy hart's-tongue ferns.

Still steadily\r\nrising, we passed over a narrow granite bridge, and skirted a noisy\r\nstream which gushed swiftly down, foaming and roaring amid the gray\r\nboulders. Both road and stream wound up through a valley dense with\r\nscrub oak and fir. At every turn Baskerville gave an exclamation of\r\ndelight, looking eagerly about him and asking countless questions. To\r\nhis eyes all seemed beautiful, but to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon\r\nthe country-side, which bore so clearly the mark of the waning year.\r\nYellow leaves carpeted the lanes and fluttered down upon us as we\r\npassed.
