{"attributes":{},"body":"enthusiasm and power of attachment. Poor Sir Charles's head was of a\r\nvery rare type, half Gaelic, half Ivernian in its characteristics. But\r\nyou were very young when you last saw Baskerville Hall, were you not?\r\n\r\nI was a boy in my 'teens at the time of my father's death, and had\r\nnever seen the Hall, for he lived in a little cottage on the South\r\nCoast. Thence I went straight to a friend in America. I tell you it is\r\nall as new to me as it is to Dr. Watson, and I'm as keen as possible to\r\nsee the moor.\r\n\r\nAre you? Then your wish is easily granted, for there is your first\r\nsight of the moor, said Dr. Mortimer, pointing out of the carriage\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\nOver the green squares of the fields and the low curve of a wood there\r\nrose in the distance a gray, melancholy hill, with a strange jagged\r\nsummit, dim and vague in the distance, like some fantastic landscape in\r\na dream. Baskerville sat for a long time, his eyes fixed upon it, and I\r\nread upon his eager face how much it meant to him, this first sight of\r\nthat strange spot where the men of his blood had held sway so long and\r\nleft their mark so deep. There he sat, with his tweed suit and his\r\nAmerican accent, in the corner of a prosaic railway-carriage, and yet as\r\nI looked at his dark and expressive face I felt more than ever how true\r\na descendant he was of that long line of high-blooded, fiery, and\r\nmasterful men. There were pride, valour, and strength in his thick\r\nbrows, his sensitive nostrils, and his large hazel eyes. If on that\r\nforbidding moor a difficult and dangerous quest should lie before us,\r\nthis was at least a comrade for whom one might venture to take a risk\r\nwith the certainty that he would bravely share it.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
