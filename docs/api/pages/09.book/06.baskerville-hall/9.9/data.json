{"attributes":{},"body":"Welcome, Sir Henry! Welcome to Baskerville Hall!\r\n\r\nA tall man had stepped from the shadow of the porch to open the door of\r\nthe wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the yellow\r\nlight of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand down our\r\nbags.\r\n\r\nYou don't mind my driving straight home, Sir Henry? said Dr.\r\nMortimer. My wife is expecting me.\r\n\r\nSurely you will stay and have some dinner?\r\n\r\nNo, I must go. I shall probably find some work awaiting me. I would\r\nstay to show you over the house, but Barrymore will be a better guide\r\nthan I. Good-bye, and never hesitate night or day to send for me if I\r\ncan be of service.\r\n\r\nThe wheels died away down the drive while Sir Henry and I turned into\r\nthe hall, and the door clanged heavily behind us. It was a fine\r\napartment in which we found ourselves, large, lofty, and heavily\r\nraftered with huge balks of age-blackened oak. In the great\r\nold-fashioned fireplace behind the high iron dogs a log-fire crackled\r\nand snapped. Sir Henry and I held out our hands to it, for we were numb\r\nfrom our long drive. Then we gazed round us at the high, thin window of\r\nold stained glass, the oak panelling, the stags' heads, the\r\ncoats-of-arms upon the walls, all dim and sombre in the subdued light of\r\nthe central lamp.\r\n\r\nIt's just as I imagined it, said Sir Henry. Is it not the very\r\npicture of an old family home? To think that this should be the same\r\nhall in which for five hundred years my people have lived. It strikes me\r\nsolemn to think of it.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
