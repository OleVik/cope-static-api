{"attributes":{},"body":"I saw his dark face lit up with a boyish enthusiasm as he gazed about\r\nhim. The light beat upon him where he stood, but long shadows trailed\r\ndown the walls and hung like a black canopy above him. Barrymore had\r\nreturned from taking our luggage to our rooms. He stood in front of us\r\nnow with the subdued manner of a well-trained servant. He was a\r\nremarkable-looking man, tall, handsome, with a square black beard and\r\npale, distinguished features.\r\n\r\nWould you wish dinner to be served at once, sir?\r\n\r\nIs it ready?\r\n\r\nIn a very few minutes, sir. You will find hot water in your rooms. My\r\nwife and I will be happy, Sir Henry, to stay with you until you have\r\nmade your fresh arrangements, but you will understand that under the new\r\nconditions this house will require a considerable staff.\r\n\r\nWhat new conditions?\r\n\r\nI only meant, sir, that Sir Charles led a very retired life, and we\r\nwere able to look after his wants. You would, naturally, wish to have\r\nmore company, and so you will need changes in your household.\r\n\r\nDo you mean that your wife and you wish to leave?\r\n\r\nOnly when it is quite convenient to you, sir.\r\n\r\nBut your family have been with us for several generations, have they\r\nnot? I should be sorry to begin my life here by breaking an old family\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nI seemed to discern some signs of emotion upon the butler's white face.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
