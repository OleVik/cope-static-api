Barrymore said that he\r\nhad.\r\n\r\nDid the boy deliver it into your own hands? asked Sir Henry.\r\n\r\nBarrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.\r\n\r\nNo, said he, I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife\r\nbrought it up to me.\r\n\r\nDid you answer it yourself?\r\n\r\nNo; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it.\r\n\r\nIn the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.\r\n\r\nI could not quite understand the object of your questions this\r\nmorning, Sir Henry, said he. I trust that they do not mean that I\r\nhave done anything to forfeit your confidence?\r\n\r\nSir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by giving\r\nhim a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit having\r\nnow all arrived.\r\n\r\nMrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person, very\r\nlimited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical. You\r\ncould hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told you how,\r\non the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and since then I\r\nhave more than once observed traces of tears upon her face. Some deep\r\nsorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if she has a guilty\r\nmemory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect Barrymore of being a\r\ndomestic tyrant. I have always felt that there was something singular\r\nand questionable in this man's character, but the adventure of last\r\nnight brings all my suspicions to a head.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
