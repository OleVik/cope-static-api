{"attributes":{},"body":"sitting before a Remington typewriter, sprang up with a pleasant smile\r\nof welcome. Her face fell, however, when she saw that I was a stranger,\r\nand she sat down again and asked me the object of my visit.\r\n\r\nThe first impression left by Mrs. Lyons was one of extreme beauty. Her\r\neyes and hair were of the same rich hazel colour, and her cheeks, though\r\nconsiderably freckled, were flushed with the exquisite bloom of the\r\nbrunette, the dainty pink which lurks at the heart of the sulphur rose.\r\nAdmiration was, I repeat, the first impression. But the second was\r\ncriticism. There was something subtly wrong with the face, some\r\ncoarseness of expression, some hardness, perhaps, of eye, some looseness\r\nof lip which marred its perfect beauty. But these, of course, are\r\nafter-thoughts. At the moment I was simply conscious that I was in the\r\npresence of a very handsome woman, and that she was asking me the\r\nreasons for my visit. I had not quite understood until that instant how\r\ndelicate my mission was.\r\n\r\nI have the pleasure, said I, of knowing your father. It was a\r\nclumsy introduction, and the lady made me feel it.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in common between my father and me, she said. I\r\nowe him nothing, and his friends are not mine. If it were not for the\r\nlate Sir Charles Baskerville and some other kind hearts I might have\r\nstarved for all that my father cared.\r\n\r\nIt was about the late Sir Charles Baskerville that I have come here to\r\nsee you.\r\n\r\nThe freckles started out on the lady's face.\r\n\r\nWhat can I tell you about him? she asked, and her fingers played\r\nnervously over the stops of her typewriter.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
