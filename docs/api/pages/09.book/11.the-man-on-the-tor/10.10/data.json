{"attributes":{},"body":"such a day since I had Sir John Morland for trespass, because he shot in\r\nhis own warren.\r\n\r\nHow on earth did you do that?\r\n\r\nLook it up in the books, sir. It will repay reading -- Frankland v.\r\nMorland, Court of Queen's Bench. It cost me 200 pounds, but I got my\r\nverdict.\r\n\r\nDid it do you any good?\r\n\r\nNone, sir, none. I am proud to say that I had no interest in the\r\nmatter. I act entirely from a sense of public duty. I have no doubt, for\r\nexample, that the Fernworthy people will burn me in effigy to-night. I\r\ntold the police last time they did it that they should stop these\r\ndisgraceful exhibitions. The County Constabulary is in a scandalous\r\nstate, sir, and it has not afforded me the protection to which I am\r\nentitled. The case of Frankland v. Regina will bring the matter before\r\nthe attention of the public. I told them that they would have occasion\r\nto regret their treatment of me, and already my words have come true.\r\n\r\nHow so? I asked.\r\n\r\nThe old man put on a very knowing expression.\r\n\r\nBecause I could tell them what they are dying to know; but nothing\r\nwould induce me to help the rascals in any way.\r\n\r\nI had been casting round for some excuse by which I could get away from\r\nhis gossip, but now I began to wish to hear more of it. I had seen\r\nenough of the contrary nature of the old sinner to understand that any\r\nstrong sign of interest would be the surest way to stop his confidences.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
