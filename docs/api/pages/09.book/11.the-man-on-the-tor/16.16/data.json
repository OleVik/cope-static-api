{"attributes":{},"body":"But there were ample signs that I had not come upon a false scent. This\r\nwas certainly where the man lived. Some blankets rolled in a waterproof\r\nlay upon that very stone slab upon which Neolithic man had once\r\nslumbered. The ashes of a fire were heaped in a rude grate. Beside it\r\nlay some cooking utensils and a bucket half-full of water. A litter of\r\nempty tins showed that the place had been occupied for some time, and I\r\nsaw, as my eyes became accustomed to the checkered light, a pannikin and\r\na half-full bottle of spirits standing in the corner. In the middle of\r\nthe hut a flat stone served the purpose of a table, and upon this stood\r\na small cloth bundle -- the same, no doubt, which I had seen through the\r\ntelescope upon the shoulder of the boy. It contained a loaf of bread, a\r\ntinned tongue, and two tins of preserved peaches. As I set it down\r\nagain, after having examined it, my heart leaped to see that beneath it\r\nthere lay a sheet of paper with writing upon it. I raised it, and this\r\nwas what I read, roughly scrawled in pencil: -- \r\n\r\nDr. Watson has gone to Coombe Tracey.\r\n\r\nFor a minute I stood there with the paper in my hands thinking out the\r\nmeaning of this curt message. It was I, then, and not Sir Henry, who was\r\nbeing dogged by this secret man. He had not followed me himself, but he\r\nhad set an agent -- the boy, perhaps -- upon my track, and this was his\r\nreport. Possibly I had taken no step since I had been upon the moor\r\nwhich had not been observed and reported. Always there was this feeling\r\nof an unseen force, a fine net drawn round us with infinite skill and\r\ndelicacy, holding us so lightly that it was only at some supreme moment\r\nthat one realized that one was indeed entangled in its meshes.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
