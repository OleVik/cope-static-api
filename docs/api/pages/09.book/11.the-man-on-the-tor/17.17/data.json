{"attributes":{},"body":"If there was one report there might be others, so I looked round the hut\r\nin search of them. There was no trace, however, of anything of the kind,\r\nnor could I discover any sign which might indicate the character or\r\nintentions of the man who lived in this singular place, save that he\r\nmust be of Spartan habits and cared little for the comforts of life.\r\nWhen I thought of the heavy rains and looked at the gaping roof I\r\nunderstood how strong and immutable must be the purpose which had kept\r\nhim in that inhospitable abode. Was he our malignant enemy, or was he by\r\nchance our guardian angel? I swore that I would not leave the hut until\r\nI knew.\r\n\r\nOutside the sun was sinking low and the west was blazing with scarlet\r\nand gold. Its reflection was shot back in ruddy patches by the distant\r\npools which lay amid the great Grimpen Mire. There were the two towers\r\nof Baskerville Hall, and there a distant blur of smoke which marked the\r\nvillage of Grimpen. Between the two, behind the hill, was the house of\r\nthe Stapletons. All was sweet and mellow and peaceful in the golden\r\nevening light, and yet as I looked at them my soul shared none of the\r\npeace of nature but quivered at the vagueness and the terror of that\r\ninterview which every instant was bringing nearer. With tingling nerves,\r\nbut a fixed purpose, I sat in the dark recess of the hut and waited with\r\nsombre patience for the coming of its tenant.\r\n\r\nAnd then at last I heard him. Far away came the sharp clink of a boot\r\nstriking upon a stone. Then another and yet another, coming nearer and\r\nnearer. I shrank back into the darkest corner, and cocked the pistol in\r\nmy pocket, determined not to discover myself until I had an opportunity\r\nof seeing something of the stranger. There was a long pause which showed\r\nthat he had stopped. Then once more the footsteps approached and a\r\nshadow fell across the opening of the hut.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
