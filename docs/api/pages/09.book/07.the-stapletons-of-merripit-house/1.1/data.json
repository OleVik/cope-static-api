{"attributes":{},"body":"The fresh beauty of the following morning did something to efface from\r\nour minds the grim and gray impression which had been left upon both of\r\nus by our first experience of Baskerville Hall. As Sir Henry and I sat\r\nat breakfast the sunlight flooded in through the high mullioned windows,\r\nthrowing watery patches of colour from the coats of arms which covered\r\nthem. The dark panelling glowed like bronze in the golden rays, and it\r\nwas hard to realize that this was indeed the chamber which had struck\r\nsuch a gloom into our souls upon the evening before.\r\n\r\nI guess it is ourselves and not the house that we have to blame!\r\nsaid the baronet. We were tired with our journey and chilled by our\r\ndrive, so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and well,\r\nso it is all cheerful once more.\r\n\r\nAnd yet it was not entirely a question of imagination, I answered.\r\nDid you, for example, happen to hear someone, a woman I think, sobbing\r\nin the night?\r\n\r\nThat is curious, for I did when I was half asleep fancy that I heard\r\nsomething of the sort. I waited quite a time, but there was no more of\r\nit, so I concluded that it was all a dream.\r\n\r\nI heard it distinctly, and I am sure that it was really the sob of a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWe must ask about this right away. He rang the bell and asked\r\nBarrymore whether he could account for our experience. It seemed to me\r\nthat the pallid features of the butler turned a shade paler still as he\r\nlistened to his master's question.\r\n\r\nThere are only two women in the house, Sir Henry, he answered. One\r\nis the scullery-maid, who sleeps in the other wing. The other is my\r\nwife, and I can answer for it that the sound could not have come from\r\nher.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
