{"attributes":{},"body":"I assure you that I am simply here upon a visit to my friend, Sir\r\nHenry, and that I need no help of any kind.\r\n\r\nExcellent! said Stapleton. You are perfectly right to be wary and\r\ndiscreet. I am justly reproved for what I feel was an unjustifiable\r\nintrusion, and I promise you that I will not mention the matter again.\r\n\r\nWe had come to a point where a narrow grassy path struck off from the\r\nroad and wound away across the moor. A steep, boulder-sprinkled hill lay\r\nupon the right which had in bygone days been cut into a granite quarry.\r\nThe face which was turned towards us formed a dark cliff, with ferns and\r\nbrambles growing in its niches. From over a distant rise there floated a\r\ngray plume of smoke.\r\n\r\nA moderate walk along this moor-path brings us to Merripit House,\r\nsaid he. Perhaps you will spare an hour that I may have the pleasure\r\nof introducing you to my sister.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was that I should be by Sir Henry's side. But then I\r\nremembered the pile of papers and bills with which his study table was\r\nlittered. It was certain that I could not help with those. And Holmes\r\nhad expressly said that I should study the neighbours upon the moor. I\r\naccepted Stapleton's invitation, and we turned together down the path.\r\n\r\nIt is a wonderful place, the moor, said he, looking round over the\r\nundulating downs, long green rollers, with crests of jagged granite\r\nfoaming up into fantastic surges. You never tire of the moor. You\r\ncannot think the wonderful secrets which it contains. It is so vast, and\r\nso barren, and so mysterious.\r\n\r\nYou know it well, then?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
