But surely such\r\nan explanation as that would be quite inadequate to account for the deep\r\nand subtle scheming which seemed to be weaving an invisible net round\r\nthe young baronet. Holmes himself had said that no more complex case had\r\ncome to him in all the long series of his sensational investigations. I\r\nprayed, as I walked back along the gray, lonely road, that my friend\r\nmight soon be freed from his preoccupations and able to come down to\r\ntake this heavy burden of responsibility from my shoulders.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my thoughts were interrupted by the sound of running feet\r\nbehind me and by a voice which called me by name. I turned, expecting to\r\nsee Dr. Mortimer, but to my surprise it was a stranger who was pursuing\r\nme. He was a small, slim, clean-shaven, prim-faced man, flaxen-haired\r\nand lean-jawed, between thirty and forty years of age, dressed in a gray\r\nsuit and wearing a straw hat. A tin box for botanical specimens hung\r\nover his shoulder and he carried a green butterfly-net in one of his\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nYou will, I am sure, excuse my presumption, Dr. Watson, said he, as\r\nhe came panting up to where I stood. Here on the moor we are homely\r\nfolk and do not wait for formal introductions. You may possibly have\r\nheard my name from our mutual friend, Mortimer. I am Stapleton, of\r\nMerripit House.\r\n\r\nYour net and box would have told me as much, said I, for I knew\r\nthat Mr. Stapleton was a naturalist. But how did you know me?\r\n\r\nI have been calling on Mortimer, and he pointed you out to me from the\r\nwindow of his surgery as you passed. As our road lay the same way I\r\nthought that I would overtake you and introduce myself. I trust that Sir\r\nHenry is none the worse for his journey?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
