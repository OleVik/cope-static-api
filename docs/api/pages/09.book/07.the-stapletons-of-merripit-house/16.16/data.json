{"attributes":{},"body":"Lepidoptera? I think it is the most complete one in the south-west of\r\nEngland. By the time that you have looked through them lunch will be\r\nalmost ready.\r\n\r\nBut I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,\r\nthe death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been\r\nassociated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things\r\ntinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or less\r\nvague impressions there had come the definite and distinct warning of\r\nMiss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness that I could not\r\ndoubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it. I resisted all\r\npressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon my return\r\njourney, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.\r\n\r\nIt seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those\r\nwho knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see\r\nMiss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face\r\nwas beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to her\r\nside.\r\n\r\nI have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson, said\r\nshe. I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my\r\nbrother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the\r\nstupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please forget\r\nthe words I said, which have no application whatever to you.\r\n\r\nBut I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton, said I. I am Sir\r\nHenry's friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell\r\nme why it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to\r\nLondon.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
