{"attributes":{},"body":"Why about Sir Henry in particular? I could not help asking.\r\n\r\nBecause I had suggested that he should come over. When he did not come\r\nI was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I\r\nheard cries upon the moor. By the way -- his eyes darted again from my\r\nface to Holmes's -- did you hear anything else besides a cry?\r\n\r\nNo, said Holmes; did you?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nWhat do you mean, then?\r\n\r\nOh, you know the stories that the peasants tell about a phantom hound,\r\nand so on. It is said to be heard at night upon the moor. I was\r\nwondering if there were any evidence of such a sound to-night.\r\n\r\nWe heard nothing of the kind, said I.\r\n\r\nAnd what is your theory of this poor fellow's death?\r\n\r\nI have no doubt that anxiety and exposure have driven him off his\r\nhead. He has rushed about the moor in a crazy state and eventually\r\nfallen over here and broken his neck.\r\n\r\nThat seems the most reasonable theory, said Stapleton, and he gave a\r\nsigh which I took to indicate his relief. What do you think about it,\r\nMr. Sherlock Holmes?\r\n\r\nMy friend bowed his compliments.\r\n\r\nYou are quick at identification, said he.\r\n\r\nWe have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came down.\r\nYou are in time to see a tragedy.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
