{"attributes":{},"body":"Yes, indeed. I have no doubt that my friend's explanation will cover\r\nthe facts. I will take an unpleasant remembrance back to London with me\r\nto-morrow.\r\n\r\nOh, you return to-morrow?\r\n\r\nThat is my intention.\r\n\r\nI hope your visit has cast some light upon those occurrences which\r\nhave puzzled us?\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nOne cannot always have the success for which one hopes. An\r\ninvestigator needs facts, and not legends or rumours. It has not been a\r\nsatisfactory case.\r\n\r\nMy friend spoke in his frankest and most unconcerned manner. Stapleton\r\nstill looked hard at him. Then he turned to me.\r\n\r\nI would suggest carrying this poor fellow to my house, but it would\r\ngive my sister such a fright that I do not feel justified in doing it. I\r\nthink that if we put something over his face he will be safe until\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,\r\nHolmes and I set off to Baskerville Hall, leaving the naturalist to\r\nreturn alone. Looking back we saw the figure moving slowly away over the\r\nbroad moor, and behind him that one black smudge on the silvered slope\r\nwhich showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly to his\r\nend.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
