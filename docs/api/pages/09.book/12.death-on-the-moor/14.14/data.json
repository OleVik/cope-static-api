{"attributes":{},"body":"the matter stood, my heart bubbling over with thankfulness and joy.\r\n\r\nThen the clothes have been the poor devil's death, said he. It is\r\nclear enough that the hound has been laid on from some article of Sir\r\nHenry's -- the boot which was abstracted in the hotel, in all\r\nprobability -- and so ran this man down. There is one very singular\r\nthing, however: How came Selden, in the darkness, to know that the hound\r\nwas on his trail?\r\n\r\nHe heard him.\r\n\r\nTo hear a hound upon the moor would not work a hard man like this\r\nconvict into such a paroxysm of terror that he would risk recapture by\r\nscreaming wildly for help. By his cries he must have run a long way\r\nafter he knew the animal was on his track. How did he know?\r\n\r\nA greater mystery to me is why this hound, presuming that all our\r\nconjectures are correct  -- \r\n\r\nI presume nothing.\r\n\r\nWell, then, why this hound should be loose to-night. I suppose that it\r\ndoes not always run loose upon the moor. Stapleton would not let it go\r\nunless he had reason to think that Sir Henry would be there.\r\n\r\nMy difficulty is the more formidable of the two, for I think that we\r\nshall very shortly get an explanation of yours, while mine may remain\r\nforever a mystery. The question now is, what shall we do with this poor\r\nwretch's body? We cannot leave it here to the foxes and the ravens.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
