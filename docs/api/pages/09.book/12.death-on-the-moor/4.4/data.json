{"attributes":{},"body":"To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nWell done! Our researches have evidently been running on parallel\r\nlines, and when we unite our results I expect we shall have a fairly\r\nfull knowledge of the case.\r\n\r\nWell, I am glad from my heart that you are here, for indeed the\r\nresponsibility and the mystery were both becoming too much for my\r\nnerves. But how in the name of wonder did you come here, and what have\r\nyou been doing? I thought that you were in Baker Street working out that\r\ncase of blackmailing.\r\n\r\nThat was what I wished you to think.\r\n\r\nThen you use me, and yet do not trust me! I cried with some\r\nbitterness. I think that I have deserved better at your hands,\r\nHolmes.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow, you have been invaluable to me in this as in many\r\nother cases, and I beg that you will forgive me if I have seemed to play\r\na trick upon you. In truth, it was partly for your own sake that I did\r\nit, and it was my appreciation of the danger which you ran which led me\r\nto come down and examine the matter for myself. Had I been with Sir\r\nHenry and you it is confident that my point of view would have been the\r\nsame as yours, and my presence would have warned our very formidable\r\nopponents to be on their guard. As it is, I have been able to get about\r\nas I could not possibly have done had I been living in the Hall, and I\r\nremain an unknown factor in the business, ready to throw in all my\r\nweight at a critical moment.\r\n\r\nBut why keep me in the dark?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
