{"attributes":{},"body":"already almost at my mercy. There is but one danger which can threaten\r\nus. It is that he should strike before we are ready to do so. Another\r\nday -- two at the most -- and I have my case complete, but until then\r\nguard your charge as closely as ever a fond mother watched her ailing\r\nchild. Your mission to-day has justified itself, and yet I could almost\r\nwish that you had not left his side. Hark!\r\n\r\nA terrible scream -- a prolonged yell of horror and anguish -- burst out\r\nof the silence of the moor. That frightful cry turned the blood to ice\r\nin my veins.\r\n\r\nOh, my God! I gasped. What is it? What does it mean?\r\n\r\nHolmes had sprung to his feet, and I saw his dark, athletic outline at\r\nthe door of the hut, his shoulders stooping, his head thrust forward,\r\nhis face peering into the darkness.\r\n\r\nHush! he whispered. Hush!\r\n\r\nThe cry had been loud on account of its vehemence, but it had pealed out\r\nfrom somewhere far off on the shadowy plain. Now it burst upon our ears,\r\nnearer, louder, more urgent than before.\r\n\r\nWhere is it? Holmes whispered; and I knew from the thrill of his\r\nvoice that he, the man of iron, was shaken to the soul. Where is it,\r\nWatson?\r\n\r\nThere, I think. I pointed into the darkness.\r\n\r\nNo, there!\r\n\r\nAgain the agonized cry swept through the silent night, louder and much\r\nnearer than ever. And a new sound mingled with it, a deep, muttered\r\nrumble, musical and yet menacing, rising and falling like the low,\r\nconstant murmur of the sea.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
