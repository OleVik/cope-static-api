{"attributes":{},"body":"That we should have heard his screams -- my God, those screams! -- and\r\nyet have been unable to save him! Where is this brute of a hound which\r\ndrove him to his death? It may be lurking among these rocks at this\r\ninstant. And Stapleton, where is he? He shall answer for this deed.\r\n\r\nHe shall. I will see to that. Uncle and nephew have been\r\nmurdered -- the one frightened to death by the very sight of a beast\r\nwhich he thought to be supernatural, the other driven to his end in his\r\nwild flight to escape from it. But now we have to prove the connection\r\nbetween the man and the beast. Save from what we heard, we cannot even\r\nswear to the existence of the latter, since Sir Henry has evidently died\r\nfrom the fall. But, by heavens, cunning as he is, the fellow shall be in\r\nmy power before another day is past!\r\n\r\nWe stood with bitter hearts on either side of the mangled body,\r\noverwhelmed by this sudden and irrevocable disaster which had brought\r\nall our long and weary labours to so piteous an end. Then, as the moon\r\nrose we climbed to the top of the rocks over which our poor friend had\r\nfallen, and from the summit we gazed out over the shadowy moor, half\r\nsilver and half gloom. Far away, miles off, in the direction of Grimpen,\r\na single steady yellow light was shining. It could only come from the\r\nlonely abode of the Stapletons. With a bitter curse I shook my fist at\r\nit as I gazed.\r\n\r\nWhy should we not seize him at once?\r\n\r\nOur case is not complete. The fellow is wary and cunning to the last\r\ndegree. It is not what we know, but what we can prove. If we make one\r\nfalse move the villain may escape us yet.\r\n\r\nWhat can we do?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
