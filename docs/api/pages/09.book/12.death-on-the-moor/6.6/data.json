{"attributes":{},"body":"fact, if you had not gone to-day it is exceedingly probable that I\r\nshould have gone to-morrow.\r\n\r\nThe sun had set and dusk was settling over the moor. The air had turned\r\nchill and we withdrew into the hut for warmth. There, sitting together\r\nin the twilight, I told Holmes of my conversation with the lady. So\r\ninterested was he that I had to repeat some of it twice before he was\r\nsatisfied.\r\n\r\nThis is most important, said he when I had concluded.
