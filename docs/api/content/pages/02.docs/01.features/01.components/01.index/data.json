{"attributes":{"title":"Index"},"body":"The _Index_ Component displays one to two [collections of Pages](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/content/collections), the first one primary and the second complementary. The standard view is to render the main collection bigger and to the right on the Page:\r\n\r\n![Index](image://breakpoints.spec.js/992/index.png)\r\n\r\nThe complementary collection will be smaller, and on the left, below the Page Title and Page Content. In the Page's Frontmatter, you can define one or both of these collections:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\ntitle: Scholar\r\ncontent:\r\n  items:\r\n    \"@page.children\": \"/docs\"\r\n  limit: 10\r\naside:\r\n  items:\r\n    \"@page.children\": \"/blog\"\r\n  order:\r\n    by: date\r\n    dir: desc\r\n  limit: 10\r\nlogo: line-awesome-book.svg\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf only the main-collection, `content`, is defined, only it is rendered:\r\n\r\n![Index](image://breakpoints.spec.js/992/blog.png)\r\n\r\nYou can also include a logo above the Page Title, by using the `logo`-property and [linking it to an image](https://learn.getgrav.org/16/content/image-linking).\r\n","bodyBegin":5,"frontmatter":"title: Index"}
