{"attributes":{},"body":"I suggest that we put it in one of the huts until we can communicate\r\nwith the police.\r\n\r\nExactly. I have no doubt that you and I could carry it so far. Halloa,\r\nWatson, what's this? It's the man himself, by all that's wonderful\r\nand audacious! Not a word to show your suspicions -- not a word, or my\r\nplans crumble to the ground.\r\n\r\nA figure was approaching us over the moor, and I saw the dull red glow\r\nof a cigar. The moon shone upon him, and I could distinguish the dapper\r\nshape and jaunty walk of the naturalist. He stopped when he saw us, and\r\nthen came on again.\r\n\r\nWhy, Dr. Watson, that's not you, is it? You are the last man that I\r\nshould have expected to see out on the moor at this time of night. But,\r\ndear me, what's this? Somebody hurt? Not -- don't tell me that it is\r\nour friend Sir Henry! He hurried past me and stooped over the dead\r\nman. I heard a sharp intake of his breath and the cigar fell from his\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nWho -- who's this? he stammered.\r\n\r\nIt is Selden, the man who escaped from Princetown.\r\n\r\nStapleton turned a ghastly face upon us, but by a supreme effort he had\r\novercome his amazement and his disappointment. He looked sharply from\r\nHolmes to me.\r\n\r\nDear me! What a very shocking affair! How did he die?\r\n\r\nHe appears to have broken his neck by falling over these rocks. My\r\nfriend and I were strolling on the moor when we heard a cry.\r\n\r\nI heard a cry also. That was what brought me out. I was uneasy about\r\nSir Henry.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
