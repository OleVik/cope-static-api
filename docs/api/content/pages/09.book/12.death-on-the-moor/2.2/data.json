{"attributes":{},"body":"when I see the stub of a cigarette marked Bradley, Oxford Street, I know\r\nthat my friend Watson is in the neighbourhood. You will see it there\r\nbeside the path. You threw it down, no doubt, at that supreme moment\r\nwhen you charged into the empty hut.\r\n\r\nExactly.\r\n\r\nI thought as much -- and knowing your admirable tenacity I was\r\nconvinced that you were sitting in ambush, a weapon within reach,\r\nwaiting for the tenant to return. So you actually thought that I was the\r\ncriminal?\r\n\r\nI did not know who you were, but I was determined to find out.\r\n\r\nExcellent, Watson! And how did you localize me? You saw me, perhaps,\r\non the night of the convict hunt, when I was so imprudent as to allow\r\nthe moon to rise behind me?\r\n\r\nYes, I saw you then.\r\n\r\nAnd have no doubt searched all the huts until you came to this one?\r\n\r\nNo, your boy had been observed, and that gave me a guide where to\r\nlook.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman with the telescope, no doubt. I could not make it\r\nout when first I saw the light flashing upon the lens. He rose and\r\npeeped into the hut. Ha, I see that Cartwright has brought up some\r\nsupplies. What's this paper? So you have been to Coombe Tracey, have\r\nyou?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
