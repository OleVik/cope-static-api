{"attributes":{},"body":"For you to know could not have helped us, and might possibly have led\r\nto my discovery. You would have wished to tell me something, or in your\r\nkindness you would have brought me out some comfort or other, and so an\r\nunnecessary risk would be run. I brought Cartwright down with me -- you\r\nremember the little chap at the express office -- and he has seen after\r\nmy simple wants: a loaf of bread and a clean collar. What does man want\r\nmore? He has given me an extra pair of eyes upon a very active pair of\r\nfeet, and both have been invaluable.\r\n\r\nThen my reports have all been wasted! -- My voice trembled as I\r\nrecalled the pains and the pride with which I had composed them.\r\n\r\nHolmes took a bundle of papers from his pocket.\r\n\r\nHere are your reports, my dear fellow, and very well thumbed, I assure\r\nyou. I made excellent arrangements, and they are only delayed one day\r\nupon their way. I must compliment you exceedingly upon the zeal and the\r\nintelligence which you have shown over an extraordinarily difficult\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nI was still rather raw over the deception which had been practised upon\r\nme, but the warmth of Holmes's praise drove my anger from my mind. I\r\nfelt also in my heart that he was right in what he said and that it was\r\nreally best for our purpose that I should not have known that he was\r\nupon the moor.\r\n\r\nThat's better, said he, seeing the shadow rise from my face. And\r\nnow tell me the result of your visit to Mrs. Laura Lyons -- it was not\r\ndifficult for me to guess that it was to see her that you had gone, for\r\nI am already aware that she is the one person in Coombe Tracey who might\r\nbe of service to us in the matter.
