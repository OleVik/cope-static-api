{"attributes":{},"body":"Well, said I, has this precious relation of yours departed, or is\r\nhe still lurking out yonder?\r\n\r\nI don't know, sir. I hope to heaven that he has gone, for he has\r\nbrought nothing but trouble here! I've not heard of him since I left\r\nout food for him last, and that was three days ago.\r\n\r\nDid you see him then?\r\n\r\nNo, sir, but the food was gone when next I went that way.\r\n\r\nThen he was certainly there?\r\n\r\nSo you would think, sir, unless it was the other man who took it.\r\n\r\nI sat with my coffee-cup halfway to my lips and stared at Barrymore.\r\n\r\nYou know that there is another man then?\r\n\r\nYes, sir; there is another man upon the moor.\r\n\r\nHave you seen him?\r\n\r\nNo, sir.\r\n\r\nHow do you know of him then?\r\n\r\nSelden told me of him, sir, a week ago or more. He's in hiding, too,\r\nbut he's not a convict as far as I can make out. I don't like it, Dr.\r\nWatson -- I tell you straight, sir, that I don't like it. He spoke\r\nwith a sudden passion of earnestness.\r\n\r\nNow, listen to me, Barrymore! I have no interest in this matter but\r\nthat of your master. I have come here with no object except to help him.\r\nTell me, frankly, what it is that you don't like.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
