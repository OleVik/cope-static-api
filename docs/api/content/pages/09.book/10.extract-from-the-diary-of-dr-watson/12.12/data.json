{"attributes":{},"body":"Barrymore hesitated for a moment, as if he regretted his outburst, or\r\nfound it difficult to express his own feelings in words.\r\n\r\nIt's all these goings-on, sir, he cried at last, waving his hand\r\ntowards the rain-lashed window which faced the moor. There's foul\r\nplay somewhere, and there's black villainy brewing, to that I'll\r\nswear! Very glad I should be, sir, to see Sir Henry on his way back to\r\nLondon again!\r\n\r\nBut what is it that alarms you?\r\n\r\nLook at Sir Charles's death! That was bad enough, for all that the\r\ncoroner said. Look at the noises on the moor at night. There's not a\r\nman would cross it after sundown if he was paid for it. Look at this\r\nstranger hiding out yonder, and watching and waiting! What's he waiting\r\nfor? What does it mean? It means no good to anyone of the name of\r\nBaskerville, and very glad I shall be to be quit of it all on the day\r\nthat Sir Henry's new servants are ready to take over the Hall.\r\n\r\nBut about this stranger, said I. Can you tell me anything about\r\nhim? What did Selden say? Did he find out where he hid, or what he was\r\ndoing?\r\n\r\nHe saw him once or twice, but he is a deep one, and gives nothing\r\naway. At first he thought that he was the police, but soon he found that\r\nhe had some lay of his own. A kind of gentleman he was, as far as he\r\ncould see, but what he was doing he could not make out.\r\n\r\nAnd where did he say that he lived?\r\n\r\nAmong the old houses on the hillside -- the stone huts where the old\r\nfolk used to live.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
