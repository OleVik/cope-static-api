{"attributes":{},"body":"old sinner and the young one the girl has had a pretty bad time.\r\n\r\nHow does she live?\r\n\r\nI fancy old Frankland allows her a pittance, but it cannot be more,\r\nfor his own affairs are considerably involved. Whatever she may have\r\ndeserved one could not allow her to go hopelessly to the bad. Her story\r\ngot about, and several of the people here did something to enable her to\r\nearn an honest living. Stapleton did for one, and Sir Charles for\r\nanother. I gave a trifle myself. It was to set her up in a typewriting\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nHe wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to satisfy\r\nhis curiosity without telling him too much, for there is no reason why\r\nwe should take anyone into our confidence. To-morrow morning I shall\r\nfind my way to Coombe Tracey, and if I can see this Mrs. Laura Lyons, of\r\nequivocal reputation, a long step will have been made towards clearing\r\none incident in this chain of mysteries. I am certainly developing the\r\nwisdom of the serpent, for when Mortimer pressed his questions to an\r\ninconvenient extent I asked him casually to what type Frankland's skull\r\nbelonged, and so heard nothing but craniology for the rest of our drive.\r\nI have not lived for years with Sherlock Holmes for nothing.\r\n\r\nI have only one other incident to record upon this tempestuous and\r\nmelancholy day. This was my conversation with Barrymore just now, which\r\ngives me one more strong card which I can play in due time.\r\n\r\nMortimer had stayed to dinner, and he and the baronet played ecart,\r\nafterwards. The butler brought me my coffee into the library, and I took\r\nthe chance to ask him a few questions.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
