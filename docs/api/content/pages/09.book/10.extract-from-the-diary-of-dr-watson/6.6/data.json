{"attributes":{},"body":"Well, Sir Henry, your uncle had a letter that morning. He had usually\r\na great many letters, for he was a public man and well known for his\r\nkind heart, so that everyone who was in trouble was glad to turn to him.\r\nBut that morning, as it chanced, there was only this one letter, so I\r\ntook the more notice of it. It was from Coombe Tracey, and it was\r\naddressed in a woman's hand.\r\n\r\nWell?\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I thought no more of the matter, and never would have done\r\nhad it not been for my wife. Only a few weeks ago she was cleaning out\r\nSir Charles's study -- it had never been touched since his death -- and\r\nshe found the ashes of a burned letter in the back of the grate. The\r\ngreater part of it was charred to pieces, but one little slip, the end\r\nof a page, hung together, and the writing could still be read, though it\r\nwas gray on a black ground. It seemed to us to be a postscript at the\r\nend of the letter, and it said: 'Please, please, as you are a\r\ngentleman, burn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o clock. Beneath\r\nit were signed the initials L. L.\r\n\r\nHave you got that slip?\r\n\r\nNo, sir, it crumbled all to bits after we moved it.\r\n\r\nHad Sir Charles received any other letters in the same writing?\r\n\r\nWell, sir, I took no particular notice of his letters. I should not\r\nhave noticed this one, only it happened to come alone.\r\n\r\nAnd you have no idea who L. L. is?\r\n\r\nNo, sir. No more than you have. But I expect if we could lay our hands\r\nupon that lady we should know more about Sir Charles's death.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
