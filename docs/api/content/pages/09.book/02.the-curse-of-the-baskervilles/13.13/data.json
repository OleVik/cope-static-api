{"attributes":{},"body":"I mention this small episode because it assumes some importance in view\r\nof the tragedy which followed, but I was convinced at the time that the\r\nmatter was entirely trivial and that his excitement had no\r\njustification.\r\n\r\nIt was at my advice that Sir Charles was about to go to London. His\r\nheart was, I knew, affected, and the constant anxiety in which he lived,\r\nhowever chimerical the cause of it might be, was evidently having a\r\nserious effect upon his health. I thought that a few months among the\r\ndistractions of town would send him back a new man. Mr. Stapleton, a\r\nmutual friend who was much concerned at his state of health, was of the\r\nsame opinion. At the last instant came this terrible catastrophe.\r\n\r\nOn the night of Sir Charles's death Barrymore the butler, who made\r\nthe discovery, sent Perkins the groom on horseback to me, and as I was\r\nsitting up late I was able to reach Baskerville Hall within an hour of\r\nthe event. I checked and corroborated all the facts which were mentioned\r\nat the inquest. I followed the footsteps down the Yew Alley, I saw the\r\nspot at the moor-gate where he seemed to have waited, I remarked the\r\nchange in the shape of the prints after that point, I noted that there\r\nwere no other footsteps save those of Barrymore on the soft gravel, and\r\nfinally I carefully examined the body, which had not been touched until\r\nmy arrival. Sir Charles lay on his face, his arms out, his fingers dug\r\ninto the ground, and his features convulsed with some strong emotion to\r\nsuch an extent that I could hardly have sworn to his identity. There was\r\ncertainly no physical injury of any kind. But one false statement was\r\nmade by Barrymore at the inquest. He said that there were no traces upon\r\nthe ground round the body. He did not observe any. But I did -- some\r\nlittle distance off, but fresh and clear.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
