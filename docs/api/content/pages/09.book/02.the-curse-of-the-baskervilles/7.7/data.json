{"attributes":{},"body":"Such is the tale, my sons, of the coming of the hound which is said to\r\nhave plagued the family so sorely ever since. If I have set it down it\r\nis because that which is clearly known hath less terror than that which\r\nis but hinted at and guessed. Nor can it be denied that many of the\r\nfamily have been unhappy in their deaths, which have been sudden,\r\nbloody, and mysterious. Yet may we shelter ourselves in the infinite\r\ngoodness of Providence, which would not forever punish the innocent\r\nbeyond that third or fourth generation which is threatened in Holy Writ.\r\nTo that Providence, my sons, I hereby commend you, and I counsel you by\r\nway of caution to forbear from crossing the moor in those dark hours\r\nwhen the powers of evil are exalted.\r\n\r\n\\[This from Hugo Baskerville to his sons Rodger and John, with\r\ninstructions that they say nothing thereof to their sister\r\nElizabeth.\\]\r\n\r\nWhen Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative he pushed\r\nhis spectacles up on his forehead and stared across at Mr. Sherlock\r\nHolmes. The latter yawned and tossed the end of his cigarette into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nWell? said he.\r\n\r\nDo you not find it interesting?\r\n\r\nTo a collector of fairy tales.\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer drew a folded newspaper out of his pocket.\r\n\r\nNow, Mr. Holmes, we will give you something a little more recent. This\r\nis the Devon County Chronicle of May 14th of this year. It is a short\r\naccount of the facts elicited at the death of Sir Charles Baskerville\r\nwhich occurred a few days before that date.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
