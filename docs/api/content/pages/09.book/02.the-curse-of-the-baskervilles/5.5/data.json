{"attributes":{},"body":"there came a galloping across the moor, and the black mare, dabbled with\r\nwhite froth, went past with trailing bridle and empty saddle. Then the\r\nrevellers rode close together, for a great fear was on them, but they\r\nstill followed over the moor, though each, had he been alone, would have\r\nbeen right glad to have turned his horse's head. Riding slowly in this\r\nfashion they came at last upon the hounds. These, though known for their\r\nvalour and their breed, were whimpering in a cluster at the head of a\r\ndeep dip or goyal, as we call it, upon the moor, some slinking away and\r\nsome, with starting hackles and staring eyes, gazing down the narrow\r\nvalley before them.\r\n\r\nThe company had come to a halt, more sober men, as you may guess, than\r\nwhen they started. The most of them would by no means advance, but three\r\nof them, the boldest, or it may be the most drunken, rode forward down\r\nthe goyal. Now, it opened into a broad space in which stood two of those\r\ngreat stones, still to be seen there, which were set by certain\r\nforgotten peoples in the days of old. The moon was shining bright upon\r\nthe clearing, and there in the centre lay the unhappy maid where she had\r\nfallen, dead of fear and of fatigue. But it was not the sight of her\r\nbody, nor yet was it that of the body of Hugo Baskerville lying near\r\nher, which raised the hair upon the heads of these three daredevil\r\nroysterers, but it was that, standing over Hugo, and plucking at his\r\nthroat, there stood a foul thing, a great, black beast, shaped like a\r\nhound, yet larger than any hound that ever mortal eye has rested upon.\r\nAnd even as they looked the thing tore the throat out of Hugo\r\nBaskerville, on which, as it turned its blazing eyes and dripping jaws\r\nupon them, the three shrieked with fear and rode for dear life, still\r\nscreaming, across the moor. One, it is said, died that very night of\r\nwhat he had seen, and the other twain were but broken men for the rest\r\nof their days.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
