{"attributes":{},"body":"I have in my pocket a manuscript, said Dr. James Mortimer.\r\n\r\nI observed it as you entered the room, said Holmes.\r\n\r\nIt is an old manuscript.\r\n\r\nEarly eighteenth century, unless it is a forgery.\r\n\r\nHow can you say that, sir?\r\n\r\nYou have presented an inch or two of it to my examination all the time\r\nthat you have been talking. It would be a poor expert who could not give\r\nthe date of a document within a decade or so. You may possibly have read\r\nmy little monograph upon the subject. I put that at 1730.\r\n\r\nThe exact date is 1742. Dr. Mortimer drew it from his breast-pocket.\r\nThis family paper was committed to my care by Sir Charles Baskerville,\r\nwhose sudden and tragic death some three months ago created so much\r\nexcitement in Devonshire. I may say that I was his personal friend as\r\nwell as his medical attendant. He was a strong-minded man, sir, shrewd,\r\npractical, and as unimaginative as I am myself. Yet he took this\r\ndocument very seriously, and his mind was prepared for just such an end\r\nas did eventually overtake him.\r\n\r\nHolmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it upon\r\nhis knee.\r\n\r\nYou will observe, Watson, the alternative use of the long s and the\r\nshort. It is one of several indications which enabled me to fix the\r\ndate.\r\n\r\nI looked over his shoulder at the yellow paper and the faded script. At\r\nthe head was written: Baskerville Hall, and below in large,\r\nscrawling figures: 1742.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
