{"attributes":{},"body":"Mr. Sherlock Holmes, who was usually very late in the mornings, save\r\nupon those not infrequent occasions when he was up all night, was seated\r\nat the breakfast table. I stood upon the hearth-rug and picked up the\r\nstick which our visitor had left behind him the night before. It was a\r\nfine, thick piece of wood, bulbous-headed, of the sort which is known as\r\na \"Penang lawyer.\" Just under the head was a broad silver band nearly\r\nan inch across. \"To James Mortimer, M.R.C.S., from his friends of the\r\nC.C.H.,\" was engraved upon it, with the date \"1884.\" It was just such\r\na stick as the old-fashioned family practitioner used to\r\ncarry -- dignified, solid, and reassuring.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Watson, what do you make of it?\"\r\n\r\nHolmes was sitting with his back to me, and I had given him no sign of\r\nmy occupation.\r\n\r\n\"How did you know what I was doing? I believe you have eyes in the back\r\nof your head.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have, at least, a well-polished, silver-plated coffee-pot in front\r\nof me,\" said he. \"But, tell me, Watson, what do you make of our\r\nvisitor's stick? Since we have been so unfortunate as to miss him and\r\nhave no notion of his errand, this accidental souvenir becomes of\r\nimportance. Let me hear you reconstruct the man by an examination of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said I, following as far as I could the methods of my\r\ncompanion, \"that Dr. Mortimer is a successful, elderly medical man,\r\nwell-esteemed since those who know him give him this mark of their\r\nappreciation.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good!\" said Holmes. \"Excellent!\"\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
