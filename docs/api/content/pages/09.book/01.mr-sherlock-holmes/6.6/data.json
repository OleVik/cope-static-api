{"attributes":{},"body":"shown in the space between these marks, is too broad in my opinion for a\r\nterrier and not broad enough for a mastiff. It may have been -- yes, by\r\nJove, it is a curly-haired spaniel.\r\n\r\nHe had risen and paced the room as he spoke. Now he halted in the recess\r\nof the window. There was such a ring of conviction in his voice that I\r\nglanced up in surprise.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow, how can you possibly be so sure of that?\r\n\r\nFor the very simple reason that I see the dog himself on our very\r\ndoor-step, and there is the ring of its owner. Don't move, I beg you,\r\nWatson. He is a professional brother of yours, and your presence may be\r\nof assistance to me. Now is the dramatic moment of fate, Watson, when\r\nyou hear a step upon the stair which is walking into your life, and you\r\nknow not whether for good or ill. What does Dr. James Mortimer, the man\r\nof science, ask of Sherlock Holmes, the specialist in crime? Come in!\r\n\r\nThe appearance of our visitor was a surprise to me, since I had expected\r\na typical country practitioner. He was a very tall, thin man, with a\r\nlong nose like a beak, which jutted out between two keen, gray eyes, set\r\nclosely together and sparkling brightly from behind a pair of\r\ngold-rimmed glasses. He was clad in a professional but rather slovenly\r\nfashion, for his frock-coat was dingy and his trousers frayed. Though\r\nyoung, his long back was already bowed, and he walked with a forward\r\nthrust of his head and a general air of peering benevolence. As he\r\nentered his eyes fell upon the stick in Holmes's hand, and he ran\r\ntowards it with an exclamation of joy. I am so very glad, said he.\r\nI was not sure whether I had left it here or in the Shipping Office. I\r\nwould not lose that stick for the world.\r\n\r\nA presentation, I see, said Holmes.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
