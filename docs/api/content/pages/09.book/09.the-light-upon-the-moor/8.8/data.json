{"attributes":{},"body":"was for her to arrange to go with me. With that I offered in as many\r\nwords to marry her, but before she could answer, down came this brother\r\nof hers, running at us with a face on him like a madman. He was just\r\nwhite with rage, and those light eyes of his were blazing with fury.\r\nWhat was I doing with the lady? How dared I offer her attentions which\r\nwere distasteful to her? Did I think that because I was a baronet I\r\ncould do what I liked? If he had not been her brother I should have\r\nknown better how to answer him. As it was I told him that my feelings\r\ntowards his sister were such as I was not ashamed of, and that I hoped\r\nthat she might honour me by becoming my wife. That seemed to make the\r\nmatter no better, so then I lost my temper too, and I answered him\r\nrather more hotly than I should perhaps, considering that she was\r\nstanding by. So it ended by his going off with her, as you saw, and here\r\nam I as badly puzzled a man as any in this county. Just tell me what it\r\nall means, Watson, and I'll owe you more than ever I can hope to pay.\r\n\r\nI tried one or two explanations, but, indeed, I was completely puzzled\r\nmyself. Our friend's title, his fortune, his age, his character, and\r\nhis appearance are all in his favour, and I know nothing against him\r\nunless it be this dark fate which runs in his family. That his advances\r\nshould be rejected so brusquely without any reference to the lady's own\r\nwishes, and that the lady should accept the situation without protest,\r\nis very amazing. However, our conjectures were set at rest by a visit\r\nfrom Stapleton himself that very afternoon. He had come to offer\r\napologies for his rudeness of the morning, and after a long private\r\ninterview with Sir Henry in his study, the upshot of their conversation\r\nwas that the breach is quite healed, and that we are to dine at Merripit\r\nHouse next Friday as a sign of it.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
