{"attributes":{},"body":"Baskerville Hall, Oct. 15th.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOLMES, -- If I was compelled to leave you without much news\r\nduring the early days of my mission you must acknowledge that I am\r\nmaking up for lost time, and that events are now crowding thick and fast\r\nupon us. In my last report I ended upon my top note with Barrymore at\r\nthe window, and now I have quite a budget already which will, unless I\r\nam much mistaken, considerably surprise you. Things have taken a turn\r\nwhich I could not have anticipated. In some ways they have within the\r\nlast forty-eight hours become much clearer and in some ways they have\r\nbecome more complicated. But I will tell you all and you shall judge for\r\nyourself.\r\n\r\nBefore breakfast on the morning following my adventure I went down the\r\ncorridor and examined the room in which Barrymore had been on the night\r\nbefore. The western window through which he had stared so intently has,\r\nI noticed, one peculiarity above all other windows in the house -- it\r\ncommands the nearest outlook on the moor. There is an opening between\r\ntwo trees which enables one from this point of view to look right down\r\nupon it, while from all the other windows it is only a distant glimpse\r\nwhich can be obtained. It follows, therefore, that Barrymore, since only\r\nthis window would serve the purpose, must have been looking out for\r\nsomething or somebody upon the moor. The night was very dark, so that I\r\ncan hardly imagine how he could have hoped to see anyone. It had struck\r\nme that it was possible that some love intrigue was on foot. That would\r\nhave accounted for his stealthy movements and also for the uneasiness of\r\nhis wife. The man is a striking-looking fellow, very well equipped to\r\nsteal the heart of a country girl, so that this theory seemed to have\r\nsomething to support it. That opening of the door which I had heard\r\nafter I had returned to my room\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
