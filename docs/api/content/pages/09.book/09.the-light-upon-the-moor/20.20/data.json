{"attributes":{},"body":"Wait here. He must be near his light. Let us see if we can get a\r\nglimpse of him.\r\n\r\nThe words were hardly out of my mouth when we both saw him. Over the\r\nrocks, in the crevice of which the candle burned, there was thrust out\r\nan evil yellow face, a terrible animal face, all seamed and scored with\r\nvile passions. Foul with mire, with a bristling beard, and hung with\r\nmatted hair, it might well have belonged to one of those old savages who\r\ndwelt in the burrows on the hillsides. The light beneath him was\r\nreflected in his small, cunning eyes which peered fiercely to right and\r\nleft through the darkness, like a crafty and savage animal who has heard\r\nthe steps of the hunters.\r\n\r\nSomething had evidently aroused his suspicions. It may have been that\r\nBarrymore had some private signal which we had neglected to give, or the\r\nfellow may have had some other reason for thinking that all was not\r\nwell, but I could read his fears upon his wicked face. Any instant he\r\nmight dash out the light and vanish in the darkness. I sprang forward\r\ntherefore, and Sir Henry did the same. At the same moment the convict\r\nscreamed out a curse at us and hurled a rock which splintered up against\r\nthe boulder which had sheltered us. I caught one glimpse of his short,\r\nsquat, strongly- built figure as he sprang to his feet and turned to\r\nrun. At the same moment by a lucky chance the moon broke through the\r\nclouds. We rushed over the brow of the hill, and there was our man\r\nrunning with great speed down the other side, springing over the stones\r\nin his way with the activity of a mountain goat. A lucky long shot of my\r\nrevolver might have crippled him, but I had brought it only to defend\r\nmyself if attacked, and not to shoot an unarmed man who was running\r\naway.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
