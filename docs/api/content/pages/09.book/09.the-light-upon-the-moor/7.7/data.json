{"attributes":{},"body":"Yes, I did.\r\n\r\nDid he ever strike you as being crazy -- this brother of hers?\r\n\r\nI can't say that he ever did.\r\n\r\nI dare say not. I always thought him sane enough until to-day, but you\r\ncan take it from me that either he or I ought to be in a strait-jacket.\r\nWhat's the matter with me, anyhow? You've lived near me for some\r\nweeks, Watson. Tell me straight, now! Is there anything that would\r\nprevent me from making a good husband to a woman that I loved?\r\n\r\nI should say not.\r\n\r\nHe can't object to my worldly position, so it must be myself that he\r\nhas this down on. What has he against me? I never hurt man or woman in\r\nmy life that I know of. And yet he would not so much as let me touch the\r\ntips of her fingers.\r\n\r\nDid he say so?\r\n\r\nThat, and a deal more. I tell you, Watson, I've only known her these\r\nfew weeks, but from the first I just felt that she was made for me, and\r\nshe, too -- she was happy when she was with me, and that I'll swear.\r\nThere's a light in a woman's eyes that speaks louder than words. But\r\nhe has never let us get together, and it was only to-day for the first\r\ntime that I saw a chance of having a few words with her alone. She was\r\nglad to meet me, but when she did it was not love that she would talk\r\nabout, and she wouldn't have let me talk about it either if she could\r\nhave stopped it. She kept coming back to it that this was a place of\r\ndanger, and that she would never be happy until I had left it. I told\r\nher that since I had seen her I was in no hurry to leave it, and that if\r\nshe really wanted me to go, the only way to work it\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
