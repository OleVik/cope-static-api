Every day we hoped that he was gone, but as long\r\nas he was there we could not desert him. That is the whole truth, as I\r\nam an honest Christian woman, and you will see that if there is blame in\r\nthe matter it does not lie with my husband, but with me, for whose sake\r\nhe has done all that he has.\r\n\r\nThe woman's words came with an intense earnestness which carried\r\nconviction with them.\r\n\r\nIs this true, Barrymore?\r\n\r\nYes, Sir Henry. Every word of it.\r\n\r\nWell, I cannot blame you for standing by your own wife. Forget what I\r\nhave said. Go to your room, you two, and we shall talk further about\r\nthis matter in the morning.\r\n\r\nWhen they were gone we looked out of the window again.
