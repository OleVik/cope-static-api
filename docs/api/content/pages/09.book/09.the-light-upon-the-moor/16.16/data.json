{"attributes":{},"body":"Well, it cannot be far if Barrymore had to carry out the food to it.\r\nAnd he is waiting, this villain, beside that candle. By thunder, Watson,\r\nI am going out to take that man!\r\n\r\nThe same thought had crossed my own mind. It was not as if the\r\nBarrymores had taken us into their confidence. Their secret had been\r\nforced from them. The man was a danger to the community, an unmitigated\r\nscoundrel for whom there was neither pity nor excuse. We were only doing\r\nour duty in taking this chance of putting him back where he could do no\r\nharm. With his brutal and violent nature, others would have to pay the\r\nprice if we held our hands. Any night, for example, our neighbours the\r\nStapletons might be attacked by him, and it may have been the thought of\r\nthis which made Sir Henry so keen upon the adventure.\r\n\r\nI will come, said I.\r\n\r\nThen get your revolver and put on your boots. The sooner we start the\r\nbetter, as the fellow may put out his light and be off.\r\n\r\nIn five minutes we were outside the door, starting upon our expedition.\r\nWe hurried through the dark shrubbery, amid the dull moaning of the\r\nautumn wind and the rustle of the falling leaves. The night air was\r\nheavy with the smell of damp and decay. Now and again the moon peeped\r\nout for an instant, but clouds were driving over the face of the sky,\r\nand just as we came out on the moor a thin rain began to fall. The light\r\nstill burned steadily in front.\r\n\r\nAre you armed? I asked.\r\n\r\nI have a hunting-crop.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
