The naturalist's angry gestures showed that\r\nthe lady was included in his displeasure. The baronet stood for a minute\r\nlooking after them, and then he walked slowly back the way that he had\r\ncome, his head hanging, the very picture of dejection.\r\n\r\nWhat all this meant I could not imagine, but I was deeply ashamed to\r\nhave witnessed so intimate a scene without my friend's knowledge.

You don't\r\nmean to say that you came after me in spite of all?\r\n\r\nI explained everything to him: how I had found it impossible to remain\r\nbehind, how I had followed him, and how I had witnessed all that had\r\noccurred. For an instant his eyes blazed at me, but my frankness\r\ndisarmed his anger, and he broke at last into a rather rueful laugh.\r\n\r\nYou would have thought the middle of that prairie a fairly safe place\r\nfor a man to be private, said he, but, by thunder, the whole\r\ncountry-side seems to have been out to see me do my wooing -- and a\r\nmighty poor wooing at that! Where had you engaged a seat?\r\n\r\nI was on that hill.\r\n\r\nQuite in the back row, eh? But her brother was well up to the front.\r\nDid you see him come out on us?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
