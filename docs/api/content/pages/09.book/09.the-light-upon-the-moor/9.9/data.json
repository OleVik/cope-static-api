{"attributes":{},"body":"I don't say now that he isn't a crazy man, said Sir Henry; I\r\ncan't forget the look in his eyes when he ran at me this morning, but I\r\nmust allow that no man could make a more handsome apology than he has\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nDid he give any explanation of his conduct?\r\n\r\nHis sister is everything in his life, he says. That is natural enough,\r\nand I am glad that he should understand her value. They have always been\r\ntogether, and according to his account he has been a very lonely man\r\nwith only her as a companion, so that the thought of losing her was\r\nreally terrible to him. He had not understood, he said, that I was\r\nbecoming attached to her, but when he saw with his own eyes that it was\r\nreally so, and that she might be taken away from him, it gave him such a\r\nshock that for a time he was not responsible for what he said or did. He\r\nwas very sorry for all that had passed, and he recognized how foolish\r\nand how selfish it was that he should imagine that he could hold a\r\nbeautiful woman like his sister to himself for her whole life. If she\r\nhad to leave him he had rather it was to a neighbour like myself than to\r\nanyone else. But in any case it was a blow to him, and it would take him\r\nsome time before he could prepare himself to meet it. He would withdraw\r\nall opposition upon his part if I would promise for three months to let\r\nthe matter rest and to be content with cultivating the lady's\r\nfriendship during that time without claiming her love. This I promised,\r\nand so the matter rests.\r\n\r\nSo there is one of our small mysteries cleared up. It is something to\r\nhave touched bottom anywhere in this bog in which we are floundering. We\r\nknow now why Stapleton looked with disfavour upon his sister's\r\nsuitor -- even when that suitor was so eligible a one as Sir Henry. And\r\nnow I pass on to another\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
