{"attributes":{},"body":"We may take it, therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated\r\nman who wished to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal\r\nhis own writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be\r\nknown, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed on\r\nin an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.\r\n'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point\r\nto carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part of\r\nthe cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the matter\r\nwas evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer of such a\r\nletter would be careless.

Now, a private pen or ink-bottle is\r\nseldom allowed to be in such a state, and the combination of the two\r\nmust be quite rare.
