{"attributes":{},"body":"very interesting document, which must have been put together and posted\r\nyesterday evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?\r\n\r\nIt is here in the corner.\r\n\r\nMight I trouble you for it -- the inside page, please, with the leading\r\narticles? He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up and down the\r\ncolumns. Capital article this on free trade. Permit me to give you an\r\nextract from it. 'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own\r\nspecial trade or your own industry will be encouraged by a protective\r\ntariff, but it stands to reason that such legislation must in the long\r\nrun keep away wealth from the country, diminish the value of our\r\nimports, and lower the general conditions of life in this island.' What\r\ndo you think of that, Watson? cried Holmes in high glee, rubbing his\r\nhands together with satisfaction. Don't you think that is an\r\nadmirable sentiment?\r\n\r\nDr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest, and\r\nSir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.\r\n\r\nI don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind, said\r\nhe; but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that\r\nnote is concerned.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir\r\nHenry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I fear\r\nthat even he has not quite grasped the significance of this sentence.\r\n\r\nNo, I confess that I see no connection.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
