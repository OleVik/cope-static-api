{"attributes":{},"body":"with extraordinary quickness and energy by our opponent, we have\r\nbetrayed ourselves and lost our man.\r\n\r\nWe had been sauntering slowly down Regent Street during this\r\nconversation, and Dr. Mortimer, with his companion, had long vanished in\r\nfront of us.\r\n\r\nThere is no object in our following them, said Holmes. The shadow\r\nhas departed and will not return. We must see what further cards we have\r\nin our hands and play them with decision. Could you swear to that man's\r\nface within the cab?\r\n\r\nI could swear only to the beard.\r\n\r\nAnd so could I -- from which I gather that in all probability it was a\r\nfalse one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a\r\nbeard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!\r\n\r\nHe turned into one of the district messenger offices, where he was\r\nwarmly greeted by the manager.\r\n\r\nAh, Wilson, I see you have not forgotten the little case in which I\r\nhad the good fortune to help you?\r\n\r\nNo, sir, indeed I have not. You saved my good name, and perhaps my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nMy dear fellow, you exaggerate. I have some recollection, Wilson, that\r\nyou had among your boys a lad named Cartwright, who showed some ability\r\nduring the investigation.\r\n\r\nYes, sir, he is still with us.\r\n\r\nCould you ring him up? -- thank you! And I should be glad to have\r\nchange of this five-pound note.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
