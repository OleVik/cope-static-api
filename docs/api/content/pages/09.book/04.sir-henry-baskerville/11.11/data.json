{"attributes":{},"body":"And also, said Holmes, that someone is not ill-disposed towards\r\nyou, since they warn you of danger.\r\n\r\nOr it may be that they wish, for their own purposes, to scare me\r\naway.\r\n\r\nWell, of course, that is possible also. I am very much indebted to\r\nyou, Dr. Mortimer, for introducing me to a problem which presents\r\nseveral interesting alternatives. But the practical point which we now\r\nhave to decide, Sir Henry, is whether it is or is not advisable for you\r\nto go to Baskerville Hall.\r\n\r\nWhy should I not go?\r\n\r\nThere seems to be danger.\r\n\r\nDo you mean danger from this family fiend or do you mean danger from\r\nhuman beings?\r\n\r\nWell, that is what we have to find out.\r\n\r\nWhichever it is, my answer is fixed. There is no devil in hell, Mr.\r\nHolmes, and there is no man upon earth who can prevent me from going to\r\nthe home of my own people, and you may take that to be my final\r\nanswer. His dark brows knitted and his face flushed to a dusky red as\r\nhe spoke. It was evident that the fiery temper of the Baskervilles was\r\nnot extinct in this their last representative. Meanwhile, said he,\r\nI have hardly had time to think over all that you have told me. It's\r\na big thing for a man to have to understand and to decide at one\r\nsitting. I should like to have a quiet hour by myself to make up my\r\nmind. Now, look here, Mr. Holmes, it's half-past eleven now and I am\r\ngoing back right away to my hotel. Suppose you and your friend, Dr.\r\nWatson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you\r\nmore clearly then how this thing strikes me.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
