{"attributes":{},"body":"Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his\r\ndressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual to\r\ntheir appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr. Mortimer\r\nwas shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was a small,\r\nalert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very sturdily built,\r\nwith thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious face. He wore a\r\nruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten appearance of one who\r\nhas spent most of his time in the open air, and yet there was something\r\nin his steady eye and the quiet assurance of his bearing which indicated\r\nthe gentleman.\r\n\r\nThis is Sir Henry Baskerville, said Dr. Mortimer.\r\n\r\nWhy, yes, said he, and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,\r\nthat if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this morning\r\nI should have come on my own account. I understand that you think out\r\nlittle puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants more thinking\r\nout than I am able to give it.\r\n\r\nPray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you have\r\nyourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in London?\r\n\r\nNothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.\r\nIt was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me this\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was of\r\ncommon quality, grayish in colour. The address, Sir Henry Baskerville,\r\nNorthumberland Hotel, was printed in rough characters; the postmark\r\nCharing Cross, and the date of posting the preceding evening.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
