Come along! We'll have a good look at him,\r\nif we can do no more.\r\n\r\nAt that instant I was aware of a bushy black beard and a pair of\r\npiercing eyes turned upon us through the side window of the cab.\r\nInstantly the trapdoor at the top flew up, something was screamed to the\r\ndriver, and the cab flew madly off down Regent Street. Holmes looked\r\neagerly round for another, but no empty one was in sight. Then he dashed\r\nin wild pursuit amid the stream of the traffic, but the start was too\r\ngreat, and already the cab was out of sight.\r\n\r\nThere now! said Holmes bitterly as he emerged panting and white with\r\nvexation from the tide of vehicles. Was ever such bad luck and such\r\nbad management, too?

How else\r\ncould it be known so quickly that it was the Northumberland Hotel which\r\nhe had chosen? If they had followed him the first day I argued that they\r\nwould follow him also the second.
