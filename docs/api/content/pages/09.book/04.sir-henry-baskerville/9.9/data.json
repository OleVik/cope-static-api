{"attributes":{},"body":"of your boots is not part of the ordinary routine of life over here.\r\n\r\nYou have lost one of your boots?\r\n\r\nMy dear sir, cried Dr. Mortimer, it is only mislaid. You will find\r\nit when you return to the hotel. What is the use of troubling Mr. Holmes\r\nwith trifles of this kind?\r\n\r\nWell, he asked me for anything outside the ordinary routine.\r\n\r\nExactly, said Holmes, however foolish the incident may seem. You\r\nhave lost one of your boots, you say?\r\n\r\nWell, mislaid it, anyhow. I put them both outside my door last night,\r\nand there was only one in the morning. I could get no sense out of the\r\nchap who cleans them. The worst of it is that I only bought the pair\r\nlast night in the Strand, and I have never had them on.\r\n\r\nIf you have never worn them, why did you put them out to be cleaned?\r\n\r\nThey were tan boots and had never been varnished. That was why I put\r\nthem out.\r\n\r\nThen I understand that on your arrival in London yesterday you went\r\nout at once and bought a pair of boots?\r\n\r\nI did a good deal of shopping. Dr. Mortimer here went round with me.\r\nYou see, if I am to be squire down there I must dress the part, and it\r\nmay be that I have got a little careless in my ways out West. Among\r\nother things I bought these brown boots -- gave six dollars for\r\nthem -- and had one stolen before ever I had them on my feet.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
