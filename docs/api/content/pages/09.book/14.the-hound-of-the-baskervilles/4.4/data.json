It was drifting slowly in our direction, and banked itself up like\r\na wall on that side of us, low, but thick and well defined. The moon\r\nshone on it, and it looked like a great shimmering ice-field, with the\r\nheads of the distant tors as rocks borne upon its surface. Holmes's\r\nface was turned towards it, and he muttered impatiently as he watched\r\nits sluggish drift.\r\n\r\nIt's moving towards us, Watson.\r\n\r\nIs that serious?\r\n\r\nVery serious, indeed -- the one thing upon earth which could have\r\ndisarranged my plans.

Broad\r\nbars of golden light from the lower windows stretched across the orchard\r\nand the moor. One of them was suddenly shut off. The servants had left\r\nthe kitchen.
