{"attributes":{},"body":"One of Sherlock Holmes's defects -- if, indeed, one may call it a\r\ndefect -- was that he was exceedingly loath to communicate his full plans\r\nto any other person until the instant of their fulfilment. Partly it\r\ncame no doubt from his own masterful nature, which loved to dominate and\r\nsurprise those who were around him. Partly also from his professional\r\ncaution, which urged him never to take any chances. The result, however,\r\nwas very trying for those who were acting as his agents and assistants.\r\nI had often suffered under it, but never more so than during that long\r\ndrive in the darkness. The great ordeal was in front of us; at last we\r\nwere about to make our final effort, and yet Holmes had said nothing,\r\nand I could only surmise what his course of action would be. My nerves\r\nthrilled with anticipation when at last the cold wind upon our faces and\r\nthe dark, void spaces on either side of the narrow road told me that we\r\nwere back upon the moor once again. Every stride of the horses and every\r\nturn of the wheels was taking us nearer to our supreme adventure.\r\n\r\nOur conversation was hampered by the presence of the driver of the hired\r\nwagonette, so that we were forced to talk of trivial matters when our\r\nnerves were tense with emotion and anticipation. It was a relief to me,\r\nafter that unnatural restraint, when we at last passed Frankland's\r\nhouse and knew that we were drawing near to the Hall and to the scene of\r\naction. We did not drive up to the door but got down near the gate of\r\nthe avenue. The wagonette was paid off and ordered to return to Coombe\r\nTracey forthwith, while we started to walk to Merripit House.\r\n\r\nAre you armed, Lestrade?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
