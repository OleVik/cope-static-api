{"attributes":{},"body":"That is certainly the dining-room.\r\n\r\nThe blinds are up. You know the lie of the land best. Creep forward\r\nquietly and see what they are doing -- but for heaven's sake don't let\r\nthem know that they are watched!\r\n\r\nI tiptoed down the path and stooped behind the low wall which surrounded\r\nthe stunted orchard. Creeping in its shadow I reached a point whence I\r\ncould look straight through the uncurtained window.\r\n\r\nThere were only two men in the room, Sir Henry and Stapleton. They sat\r\nwith their profiles towards me on either side of the round table. Both\r\nof them were smoking cigars, and coffee and wine were in front of them.\r\nStapleton was talking with animation, but the baronet looked pale and\r\ndistrait. Perhaps the thought of that lonely walk across the ill-omened\r\nmoor was weighing heavily upon his mind.\r\n\r\nAs I watched them Stapleton rose and left the room, while Sir Henry\r\nfilled his glass again and leaned back in his chair, puffing at his\r\ncigar. I heard the creak of a door and the crisp sound of boots upon\r\ngravel. The steps passed along the path on the other side of the wall\r\nunder which I crouched. Looking over, I saw the naturalist pause at the\r\ndoor of an out-house in the corner of the orchard. A key turned in a\r\nlock, and as he passed in there was a curious scuffling noise from\r\nwithin. He was only a minute or so inside, and then I heard the key turn\r\nonce more and he passed me and re-entered the house. I saw him rejoin\r\nhis guest, and I crept quietly back to where my companions were waiting\r\nto tell them what I had seen.\r\n\r\nYou say, Watson, that the lady is not there? Holmes asked, when I\r\nhad finished my report.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
