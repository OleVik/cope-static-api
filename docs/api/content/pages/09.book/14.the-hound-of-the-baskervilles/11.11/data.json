{"attributes":{},"body":"He tried to stagger to his feet; but he was still ghastly pale and\r\ntrembling in every limb. We helped him to a rock, where he sat shivering\r\nwith his face buried in his hands.\r\n\r\nWe must leave you now, said Holmes. The rest of our work must be\r\ndone, and every moment is of importance. We have our case, and now we\r\nonly want our man.\r\n\r\nIt's a thousand to one against our finding him at the house, he\r\ncontinued as we retraced our steps swiftly down the path. Those shots\r\nmust have told him that the game was up.\r\n\r\nWe were some distance off, and this fog may have deadened them.\r\n\r\nHe followed the hound to call him off -- of that you may be certain.\r\nNo, no, he's gone by this time! But we'll search the house and make\r\nsure.\r\n\r\nThe front door was open, so we rushed in and hurried from room to room\r\nto the amazement of a doddering old manservant, who met us in the\r\npassage. There was no light save in the dining-room, but Holmes caught\r\nup the lamp and left no corner of the house unexplored. No sign could we\r\nsee of the man whom we were chasing. On the upper floor, however, one of\r\nthe bedroom doors was locked.\r\n\r\nThere's someone in here, cried Lestrade. I can hear a movement.\r\nOpen this door!\r\n\r\nA faint moaning and rustling came from within. Holmes struck the door\r\njust over the lock with the flat of his foot and it flew open. Pistol in\r\nhand, we all three rushed into the room.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
