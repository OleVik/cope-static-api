{"attributes":{},"body":"We're at close grips at last, said Holmes as we walked together\r\nacross the moor. What a nerve the fellow has! How he pulled himself\r\ntogether in the face of what must have been a paralyzing shock when he\r\nfound that the wrong man had fallen a victim to his plot. I told you in\r\nLondon, Watson, and I tell you now again, that we have never had a\r\nfoeman more worthy of our steel.\r\n\r\nI am sorry that he has seen you.\r\n\r\nAnd so was I at first. But there was no getting out of it.\r\n\r\nWhat effect do you think it will have upon his plans now that he knows\r\nyou are here?\r\n\r\nIt may cause him to be more cautious, or it may drive him to desperate\r\nmeasures at once. Like most clever criminals, he may be too confident in\r\nhis own cleverness and imagine that he has completely deceived us.\r\n\r\nWhy should we not arrest him at once?\r\n\r\nMy dear Watson, you were born to be a man of action. Your instinct is\r\nalways to do something energetic. But supposing, for argument's sake,\r\nthat we had him arrested to-night, what on earth the better off should\r\nwe be for that? We could prove nothing against him. There's the\r\ndevilish cunning of it! If he were acting through a human agent we could\r\nget some evidence, but if we were to drag this great dog to the light of\r\nday it would not help us in putting a rope round the neck of its\r\nmaster.\r\n\r\nSurely we have a case.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
