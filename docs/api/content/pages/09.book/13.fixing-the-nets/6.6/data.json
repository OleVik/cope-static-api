{"attributes":{},"body":"Well, I'm glad to hear you say so, said Sir Henry, glancing with\r\nsome surprise at my friend. I don't pretend to know much about these\r\nthings, and I'd be a better judge of a horse or a steer than of a\r\npicture. I didn't know that you found time for such things.\r\n\r\nI know what is good when I see it, and I see it now. That's a\r\nKneller, I'll swear, that lady in the blue silk over yonder, and the\r\nstout gentleman with the wig ought to be a Reynolds. They are all family\r\nportraits, I presume?\r\n\r\nEvery one.\r\n\r\nDo you know the names?\r\n\r\nBarrymore has been coaching me in them, and I think I can say my\r\nlessons fairly well.\r\n\r\nWho is the gentleman with the telescope?\r\n\r\nThat is Rear-Admiral Baskerville, who served under Rodney in the West\r\nIndies. The man with the blue coat and the roll of paper is Sir William\r\nBaskerville, who was Chairman of Committees of the House of Commons\r\nunder Pitt.\r\n\r\nAnd this Cavalier opposite to me -- the one with the black velvet and\r\nthe lace?\r\n\r\nAh, you have a right to know about him. That is the cause of all the\r\nmischief, the wicked Hugo, who started the Hound of the Baskervilles.\r\nWe're not likely to forget him.\r\n\r\nI gazed with interest and some surprise upon the portrait.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
