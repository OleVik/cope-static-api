Coming down with unsigned warrant. Arrive\r\nfive-forty. -- LESTRADE.\r\n\r\nThat is in answer to mine of this morning. He is the best of the\r\nprofessionals, I think, and we may need his assistance. Now, Watson, I\r\nthink that we cannot employ our time better than by calling upon your\r\nacquaintance, Mrs. Laura Lyons.\r\n\r\nHis plan of campaign was beginning to be evident. He would use the\r\nbaronet in order to convince the Stapletons that we were really gone,\r\nwhile we should actually return at the instant when we were likely to be\r\nneeded. That telegram from London, if mentioned by Sir Henry to the\r\nStapletons, must remove the last suspicions from their minds. Already I\r\nseemed to see our nets drawing closer around that lean-jawed pike.\r\n\r\nMrs. Laura Lyons was in her office, and Sherlock Holmes opened his\r\ninterview with a frankness and directness which considerably amazed her.\r\n\r\nI am investigating the circumstances which attended the death of the\r\nlate Sir Charles Baskerville, said he. My friend here, Dr. Watson,\r\nhas informed me of what you have communicated, and also of what you have\r\nwithheld in connection with that matter.\r\n\r\nWhat have I withheld? she asked defiantly.\r\n\r\nYou have confessed that you asked Sir Charles to be at the gate at ten\r\no'clock. We know that that was the place and hour of his death. You\r\nhave withheld what the connection is between these events.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
