We hope very soon to return to Devonshire.\r\nWill you remember to give them that message?\r\n\r\nIf you insist upon it.\r\n\r\nThere is no alternative, I assure you.\r\n\r\nI saw by the baronet's clouded brow that he was deeply hurt by what he\r\nregarded as our desertion.\r\n\r\nWhen do you desire to go? he asked coldly.\r\n\r\nImmediately after breakfast. We will drive in to Coombe Tracey, but\r\nWatson will leave his things as a pledge that he will come back to you.\r\nWatson, you will send a note to Stapleton to tell him that you regret\r\nthat you cannot come.\r\n\r\nI have a good mind to go to London with you, said the baronet. Why\r\nshould I stay here alone?\r\n\r\nBecause it is your post of duty. Because you gave me your word that\r\nyou would do as you were told, and I tell you to stay.\r\n\r\nAll right, then, I'll stay.\r\n\r\nOne more direction! I wish you to drive to Merripit House. Send back\r\nyour trap, however, and let them know that you intend to walk home.\r\n\r\nTo walk across the moor?\r\n\r\nYes.\r\n\r\nBut that is the very thing which you have so often cautioned me not to\r\ndo.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
