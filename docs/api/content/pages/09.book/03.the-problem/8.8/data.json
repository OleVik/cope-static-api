{"attributes":{},"body":"will be of help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir\r\nHenry Baskerville with you.\r\n\r\nI will do so, Mr. Holmes. He scribbled the appointment on his\r\nshirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded\r\nfashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.\r\n\r\nOnly one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir Charles\r\nBaskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon the moor?\r\n\r\nThree people did.\r\n\r\nDid any see it after?\r\n\r\nI have not heard of any.\r\n\r\nThank you. Good morning.\r\n\r\nHolmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward satisfaction\r\nwhich meant that he had a congenial task before him.\r\n\r\nGoing out, Watson?\r\n\r\nUnless I can help you.\r\n\r\nNo, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you for\r\naid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of view. When\r\nyou pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound of the\r\nstrongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you could make\r\nit convenient not to return before evening. Then I should be very glad\r\nto compare impressions as to this most interesting problem which has\r\nbeen submitted to us this morning.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
