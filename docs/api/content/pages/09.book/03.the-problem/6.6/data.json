{"attributes":{},"body":"Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young gentleman\r\nand found that he had been farming in Canada. From the accounts which\r\nhave reached us he is an excellent fellow in every way. I speak not as a\r\nmedical man but as a trustee and executor of Sir Charles's will.\r\n\r\nThere is no other claimant, I presume?\r\n\r\nNone. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was\r\nRodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir\r\nCharles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the father\r\nof this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of the family.\r\nHe came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was the very image,\r\nthey tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He made England too hot\r\nto hold him, fled to Central America, and died there in 1876 of yellow\r\nfever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles. In one hour and five\r\nminutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have had a wire that he\r\narrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr. Holmes, what would you\r\nadvise me to do with him?\r\n\r\nWhy should he not go to the home of his fathers?\r\n\r\nIt seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every\r\nBaskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that if\r\nSir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would have\r\nwarned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and the heir\r\nto great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be denied that\r\nthe prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side depends upon his\r\npresence. All the good work which has been done by Sir Charles will\r\ncrash to the ground if there is no tenant of the Hall. I fear lest I\r\nshould be swayed too much by my own obvious interest in the matter,\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
