{"attributes":{},"body":"one a moorland farmer, who all tell the same story of this dreadful\r\napparition, exactly corresponding to the hell-hound of the legend. I\r\nassure you that there is a reign of terror in the district, and that it\r\nis a hardy man who will cross the moor at night.\r\n\r\nAnd you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?\r\n\r\nI do not know what to believe.\r\n\r\nHolmes shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto confined my investigations to this world, said he.\r\nIn a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of\r\nEvil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must admit\r\nthat the footmark is material.\r\n\r\nThe original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out, and\r\nyet he was diabolical as well.\r\n\r\nI see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But now,\r\nDr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have you come\r\nto consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it is useless\r\nto investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me to do it.\r\n\r\nI did not say that I desired you to do it.\r\n\r\nThen, how can I assist you?\r\n\r\nBy advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville, who\r\narrives at Waterloo Station -- Dr. Mortimer looked at his watch -- in\r\nexactly one hour and a quarter.\r\n\r\nHe being the heir?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
