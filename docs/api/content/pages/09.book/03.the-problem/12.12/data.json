{"attributes":{},"body":"Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day.\r\n\r\nWhat do you make of it?\r\n\r\nIt is very bewildering. It has certainly a character of its own.\r\nThere are points of distinction about it. That change in the footprints,\r\nfor example. What do you make of that?\r\n\r\nMortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of\r\nthe alley.\r\n\r\nHe only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should a\r\nman walk on tiptoe down the alley?\r\n\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\nHe was running, Watson -- running desperately, running for his life,\r\nrunning until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face.\r\n\r\nRunning from what?\r\n\r\nThere lies our problem. There are indications that the man was crazed\r\nwith fear before ever he began to run.\r\n\r\nHow can you say that?\r\n\r\nI am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the\r\nmoor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had\r\nlost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If\r\nthe gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help\r\nin the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom\r\nwas he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the Yew\r\nAlley rather than in his own house?\r\n\r\nYou think that he was waiting for someone?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
