{"attributes":{},"body":"So it was, sir. And now it's an old black one.\r\n\r\nWhat! you don't mean to say\\-\\- -- ?\r\n\r\nThat's just what I do mean to say. I only had three pairs in the\r\nworld -- the new brown, the old black, and the patent leathers, which I\r\nam wearing. Last night they took one of my brown ones, and to-day they\r\nhave sneaked one of the black. Well, have you got it? Speak out, man,\r\nand don't stand staring!\r\n\r\nAn agitated German waiter had appeared upon the scene.\r\n\r\nNo, sir; I have made inquiry all over the hotel, but I can hear no\r\nword of it.\r\n\r\nWell, either that boot comes back before sundown or I'll see the\r\nmanager and tell him that I go right straight out of this hotel.\r\n\r\nIt shall be found, sir -- I promise you that if you will have a little\r\npatience it will be found.\r\n\r\nMind it is, for it's the last thing of mine that I'll lose in this\r\nden of thieves. Well, well, Mr. Holmes, you'll excuse my troubling you\r\nabout such a trifle\\-\\- -- \r\n\r\nI think it's well worth troubling about.\r\n\r\nWhy, you look very serious over it.\r\n\r\nHow do you explain it?\r\n\r\nI just don't attempt to explain it. It seems the very maddest,\r\nqueerest thing that ever happened to me.\r\n\r\nThe queerest perhaps\\-\\- --  said Holmes, thoughtfully.\r\n\r\nWhat do you make of it yourself?\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
