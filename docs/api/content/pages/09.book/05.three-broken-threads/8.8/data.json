{"attributes":{},"body":"you will forgive the unpleasant hypothesis! -- who would inherit the\r\nestate?\r\n\r\nSince Rodger Baskerville, Sir Charles's younger brother died\r\nunmarried, the estate would descend to the Desmonds, who are distant\r\ncousins. James Desmond is an elderly clergyman in Westmoreland.\r\n\r\nThank you. These details are all of great interest. Have you met Mr.\r\nJames Desmond?\r\n\r\nYes; he once came down to visit Sir Charles. He is a man of venerable\r\nappearance and of saintly life. I remember that he refused to accept any\r\nsettlement from Sir Charles, though he pressed it upon him.\r\n\r\nAnd this man of simple tastes would be the heir to Sir Charles's\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\nHe would be the heir to the estate because that is entailed. He would\r\nalso be the heir to the money unless it were willed otherwise by the\r\npresent owner, who can, of course, do what he likes with it.\r\n\r\nAnd have you made your will, Sir Henry?\r\n\r\nNo, Mr. Holmes, I have not. I've had no time, for it was only\r\nyesterday that I learned how matters stood. But in any case I feel that\r\nthe money should go with the title and estate. That was my poor uncle's\r\nidea. How is the owner going to restore the glories of the Baskervilles\r\nif he has not money enough to keep up the property? House, land, and\r\ndollars must go together.\r\n\r\nQuite so. Well, Sir Henry, I am of one mind with you as to the\r\nadvisability of your going down to Devonshire without delay.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
