There's another one waiting\r\nfor you if you can bring any more information. Good night!\r\n\r\nGood night, sir, and thank you!\r\n\r\nJohn Clayton departed chuckling, and Holmes turned to me with a shrug of\r\nhis shoulders and a rueful smile.\r\n\r\nSnap goes our third thread, and we end where we began, said he.\r\nThe cunning rascal! He knew our number, knew that Sir Henry\r\nBaskerville had consulted me, spotted who I was in Regent Street,\r\nconjectured that I had got the number of the cab and would lay my hands\r\non the driver, and so sent back this audacious message. I tell you,\r\nWatson, this time we have got a foeman who is worthy of our steel. I've\r\nbeen checkmated in London. I can only wish you better luck in\r\nDevonshire. But I'm not easy in my mind about it.\r\n\r\nAbout what?\r\n\r\nAbout sending you. It's an ugly business, Watson, an ugly dangerous\r\nbusiness, and the more I see of it the less I like it. Yes, my dear\r\nfellow, you may laugh, but I give you my word that I shall be very glad\r\nto have you back safe and sound in Baker Street once more.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
