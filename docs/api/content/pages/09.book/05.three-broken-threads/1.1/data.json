{"attributes":{},"body":"Sherlock Holmes had, in a very remarkable degree, the power of detaching\r\nhis mind at will. For two hours the strange business in which we had\r\nbeen involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was entirely absorbed in\r\nthe pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He would talk of nothing but\r\nart, of which he had the crudest ideas, from our leaving the gallery\r\nuntil we found ourselves at the Northumberland Hotel.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Baskerville is upstairs expecting you, said the clerk.\r\nHe asked me to show you up at once when you came.\r\n\r\nHave you any objection to my looking at your register? said Holmes.\r\n\r\nNot in the least.\r\n\r\nThe book showed that two names had been added after that of Baskerville.\r\nOne was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the other Mrs.\r\nOldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.\r\n\r\nSurely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know, said\r\nHolmes to the porter. A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks with\r\na limp?\r\n\r\nNo, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active gentleman,\r\nnot older than yourself.\r\n\r\nSurely you are mistaken about his trade?\r\n\r\nNo, sir! he has used this hotel for many years, and he is very well\r\nknown to us.\r\n\r\nAh, that settles it. Mrs. Oldmore, too; I seem to remember the name.\r\nExcuse my curiosity, but often in calling upon one friend one finds\r\nanother.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
