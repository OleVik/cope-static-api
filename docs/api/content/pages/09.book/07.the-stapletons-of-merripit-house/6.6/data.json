{"attributes":{},"body":"You think, then, that some dog pursued Sir Charles, and that he died\r\nof fright in consequence?\r\n\r\nHave you any better explanation?\r\n\r\nI have not come to any conclusion.\r\n\r\nHas Mr. Sherlock Holmes?\r\n\r\nThe words took away my breath for an instant, but a glance at the placid\r\nface and steadfast eyes of my companion showed that no surprise was\r\nintended.\r\n\r\nIt is useless for us to pretend that we do not know you, Dr. Watson,\r\nsaid he. The records of your detective have reached us here, and you\r\ncould not celebrate him without being known yourself. When Mortimer told\r\nme your name he could not deny your identity. If you are here, then it\r\nfollows that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is interesting himself in the matter,\r\nand I am naturally curious to know what view he may take.\r\n\r\nI am afraid that I cannot answer that question.\r\n\r\nMay I ask if he is going to honour us with a visit himself?\r\n\r\nHe cannot leave town at present. He has other cases which engage his\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nWhat a pity! He might throw some light on that which is so dark to us.\r\nBut as to your own researches, if there is any possible way in which I\r\ncan be of service to you I trust that you will command me. If I had any\r\nindication of the nature of your suspicions or how you propose to\r\ninvestigate the case, I might perhaps even now give you some aid or\r\nadvice.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
