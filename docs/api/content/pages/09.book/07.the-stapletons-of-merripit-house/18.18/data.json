I fear\r\nthat unless you can give me some more definite information than this it\r\nwould be impossible to get him to move.\r\n\r\nI cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything definite.\r\n\r\nI would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no\r\nmore than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish your\r\nbrother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he, or\r\nanyone else, could object.\r\n\r\nMy brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks\r\nit is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very\r\nangry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir Henry\r\nto go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more. I must\r\nget back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you.\r\nGood-bye! She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the\r\nscattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears, pursued\r\nmy way to Baskerville Hall.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
