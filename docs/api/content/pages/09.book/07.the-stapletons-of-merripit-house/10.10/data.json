Stapleton\r\nlooked at me with a curious expression in his face.\r\n\r\nQueer place, the moor! said he.\r\n\r\nBut what is it?\r\n\r\nThe peasants say it is the Hound of the Baskervilles calling for its\r\nprey. I've heard it once or twice before, but never quite so loud.\r\n\r\nI looked round, with a chill of fear in my heart, at the huge swelling\r\nplain, mottled with the green patches of rushes. Nothing stirred over\r\nthe vast expanse save a pair of ravens, which croaked loudly from a tor\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\nYou are an educated man. You don't believe such nonsense as that?\r\nsaid I. What do you think is the cause of so strange a sound?\r\n\r\nBogs make queer noises sometimes. It's the mud settling, or the water\r\nrising, or something.\r\n\r\nNo, no, that was a living voice.\r\n\r\nWell, perhaps it was. Did you ever hear a bittern booming?\r\n\r\nNo, I never did.\r\n\r\nIt's a very rare bird -- practically extinct -- in England now, but all\r\nthings are possible upon the moor. Yes, I should not be surprised to\r\nlearn that what we have heard is the cry of the last of the bitterns.\r\n\r\nIt's the weirdest, strangest thing that ever I heard in my life.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
