{"attributes":{},"body":"No, no, said I. Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is\r\nDr. Watson.\r\n\r\nA flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. We have been\r\ntalking at cross purposes, said she.\r\n\r\nWhy, you had not very much time for talk, her brother remarked with\r\nthe same questioning eyes.\r\n\r\nI talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a\r\nvisitor, said she. It cannot much matter to him whether it is early\r\nor late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see\r\nMerripit House?\r\n\r\nA short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm of\r\nsome grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair and\r\nturned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the trees,\r\nas is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the effect of\r\nthe whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted by a strange,\r\nwizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in keeping with the\r\nhouse. Inside, however, there were large rooms furnished with an\r\nelegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste of the lady. As I\r\nlooked from their windows at the interminable granite-flecked moor\r\nrolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could not but marvel at what\r\ncould have brought this highly educated man and this beautiful woman to\r\nlive in such a place.\r\n\r\nQueer spot to choose, is it not? said he as if in answer to my\r\nthought. And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we not,\r\nBeryl?\r\n\r\nQuite happy, said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her\r\nwords.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
