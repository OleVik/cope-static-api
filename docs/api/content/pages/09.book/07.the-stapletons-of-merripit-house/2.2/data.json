{"attributes":{},"body":"And yet he lied as he said it, for it chanced that after breakfast I met\r\nMrs. Barrymore in the long corridor with the sun full upon her face. She\r\nwas a large, impassive, heavy-featured woman with a stern set expression\r\nof mouth. But her tell-tale eyes were red and glanced at me from between\r\nswollen lids. It was she, then, who wept in the night, and if she did so\r\nher husband must know it. Yet he had taken the obvious risk of discovery\r\nin declaring that it was not so. Why had he done this? And why did she\r\nweep so bitterly? Already round this pale-faced, handsome, black-bearded\r\nman there was gathering an atmosphere of mystery and of gloom. It was he\r\nwho had been the first to discover the body of Sir Charles, and we had\r\nonly his word for all the circumstances which led up to the old man's\r\ndeath. Was it possible that it was Barrymore after all whom we had seen\r\nin the cab in Regent Street? The beard might well have been the same.\r\nThe cabman had described a somewhat shorter man, but such an impression\r\nmight easily have been erroneous. How could I settle the point forever?\r\nObviously the first thing to do was to see the Grimpen postmaster, and\r\nfind whether the test telegram had really been placed in Barrymore's\r\nown hands. Be the answer what it might, I should at least have something\r\nto report to Sherlock Holmes.\r\n\r\nSir Henry had numerous papers to examine after breakfast, so that the\r\ntime was propitious for my excursion. It was a pleasant walk of four\r\nmiles along the edge of the moor, leading me at last to a small gray\r\nhamlet, in which two larger buildings, which proved to be the inn and\r\nthe house of Dr. Mortimer, stood high above the rest. The postmaster,\r\nwho was also the village grocer, had a clear recollection of the\r\ntelegram.\r\n\r\nCertainly, sir, said he, I had the telegram delivered to Mr.\r\nBarrymore exactly as directed.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
