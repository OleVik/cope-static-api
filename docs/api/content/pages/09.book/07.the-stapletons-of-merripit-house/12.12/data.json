She had come from the direction in\r\nwhich the plume of smoke indicated the position of Merripit House, but\r\nthe dip of the moor had hid her until she was quite close.\r\n\r\nI could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been\r\ntold, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I\r\nremembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty. The\r\nwoman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most uncommon type.\r\nThere could not have been a greater contrast between brother and sister,\r\nfor Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair and gray eyes, while\r\nshe was darker than any brunette whom I have seen in England -- slim,\r\nelegant, and tall.
