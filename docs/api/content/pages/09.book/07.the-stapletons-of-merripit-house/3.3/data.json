James, you delivered that telegram to Mr. Barrymore at\r\nthe Hall last week, did you not?\r\n\r\nYes, father, I delivered it.\r\n\r\nInto his own hands? I asked.\r\n\r\nWell, he was up in the loft at the time, so that I could not put it\r\ninto his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she\r\npromised to deliver it at once.\r\n\r\nDid you see Mr. Barrymore?\r\n\r\nNo, sir; I tell you he was in the loft.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't see him, how do you know he was in the loft?\r\n\r\nWell, surely his own wife ought to know where he is, said the\r\npostmaster testily.

Was he the\r\nagent of others or had he some sinister design of his own? What interest\r\ncould he have in persecuting the Baskerville family? I thought of the\r\nstrange warning clipped out of the leading article of the Times. Was\r\nthat his work or was it possibly the doing of someone who was bent upon\r\ncounteracting his schemes?
