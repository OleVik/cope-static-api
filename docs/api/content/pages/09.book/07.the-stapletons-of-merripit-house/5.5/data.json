{"attributes":{},"body":"He is very well, thank you.\r\n\r\nWe were all rather afraid that after the sad death of Sir Charles the\r\nnew baronet might refuse to live here. It is asking much of a wealthy\r\nman to come down and bury himself in a place of this kind, but I need\r\nnot tell you that it means a very great deal to the country-side. Sir\r\nHenry has, I suppose, no superstitious fears in the matter?\r\n\r\nI do not think that it is likely.\r\n\r\nOf course you know the legend of the fiend dog which haunts the\r\nfamily?\r\n\r\nI have heard it.\r\n\r\nIt is extraordinary how credulous the peasants are about here! Any\r\nnumber of them are ready to swear that they have seen such a creature\r\nupon the moor. He spoke with a smile, but I seemed to read in his eyes\r\nthat he took the matter more seriously. The story took a great hold\r\nupon the imagination of Sir Charles, and I have no doubt that it led to\r\nhis tragic end.\r\n\r\nBut how?\r\n\r\nHis nerves were so worked up that the appearance of any dog might have\r\nhad a fatal effect upon his diseased heart. I fancy that he really did\r\nsee something of the kind upon that last night in the Yew Alley. I\r\nfeared that some disaster might occur, for I was very fond of the old\r\nman, and I knew that his heart was weak.\r\n\r\nHow did you know that?\r\n\r\nMy friend Mortimer told me.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
