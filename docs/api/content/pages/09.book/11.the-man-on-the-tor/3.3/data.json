{"attributes":{},"body":"You knew him, did you not?\r\n\r\nI have already said that I owe a great deal to his kindness. If I am\r\nable to support myself it is largely due to the interest which he took\r\nin my unhappy situation.\r\n\r\nDid you correspond with him?\r\n\r\nThe lady looked quickly up with an angry gleam in her hazel eyes.\r\n\r\nWhat is the object of these questions? she asked sharply.\r\n\r\nThe object is to avoid a public scandal. It is better that I should\r\nask them here than that the matter should pass outside our control.\r\n\r\nShe was silent and her face was still very pale. At last she looked up\r\nwith something reckless and defiant in her manner.\r\n\r\nWell, I'll answer, she said. What are your questions?\r\n\r\nDid you correspond with Sir Charles?\r\n\r\nI certainly wrote to him once or twice to acknowledge his delicacy and\r\nhis generosity.\r\n\r\nHave you the dates of those letters?\r\n\r\nNo.\r\n\r\nHave you ever met him?\r\n\r\nYes, once or twice, when he came into Coombe Tracey. He was a very\r\nretiring man, and he preferred to do good by stealth.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
