A haze lay low upon the farthest sky-line, out of\r\nwhich jutted the fantastic shapes of Belliver and Vixen Tor. Over the\r\nwide expanse there was no sound and no movement. One great gray bird, a\r\ngull or curlew, soared aloft in the blue heaven. He and I seemed to be\r\nthe only living things between the huge arch of the sky and the desert\r\nbeneath it.
