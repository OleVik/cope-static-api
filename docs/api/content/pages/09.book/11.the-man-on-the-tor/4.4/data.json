{"attributes":{},"body":"But if you saw him so seldom and wrote so seldom, how did he know\r\nenough about your affairs to be able to help you, as you say that he has\r\ndone?\r\n\r\nShe met my difficulty with the utmost readiness.\r\n\r\nThere were several gentlemen who knew my sad history and united to\r\nhelp me. One was Mr. Stapleton, a neighbour and intimate friend of Sir\r\nCharles's. He was exceedingly kind, and it was through him that Sir\r\nCharles learned about my affairs.\r\n\r\nI knew already that Sir Charles Baskerville had made Stapleton his\r\nalmoner upon several occasions, so the lady's statement bore the\r\nimpress of truth upon it.\r\n\r\nDid you ever write to Sir Charles asking him to meet you? I\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lyons flushed with anger again.\r\n\r\nReally, sir, this is a very extraordinary question.\r\n\r\nI am sorry, madam, but I must repeat it.\r\n\r\nThen I answer, certainly not.\r\n\r\nNot on the very day of Sir Charles's death?\r\n\r\nThe flush had faded in an instant, and a deathly face was before me. Her\r\ndry lips could not speak the No which I saw rather than heard.\r\n\r\nSurely your memory deceives you, said I. I could even quote a\r\npassage of your letter. It ran 'Please, please, as you are a gentleman,\r\nburn this letter, and be at the gate by ten o'clock.'\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
