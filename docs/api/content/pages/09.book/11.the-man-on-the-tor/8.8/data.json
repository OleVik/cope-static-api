I came\r\naway baffled and disheartened. Once again I had reached that dead wall\r\nwhich seemed to be built across every path by which I tried to get at\r\nthe object of my mission. And yet the more I thought of the lady's face\r\nand of her manner the more I felt that something was being held back\r\nfrom me. Why should she turn so pale?
