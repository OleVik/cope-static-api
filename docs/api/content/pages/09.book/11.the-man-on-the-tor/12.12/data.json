{"attributes":{},"body":"I should say that it was much more likely that it was the son of one\r\nof the moorland shepherds taking out his father's dinner.\r\n\r\nThe least appearance of opposition struck fire out of the old autocrat.\r\nHis eyes looked malignantly at me, and his gray whiskers bristled like\r\nthose of an angry cat.\r\n\r\nIndeed, sir! said he, pointing out over the wide-stretching moor.\r\nDo you see that Black Tor over yonder? Well, do you see the low hill\r\nbeyond with the thornbush upon it? It is the stoniest part of the whole\r\nmoor. Is that a place where a shepherd would be likely to take his\r\nstation? Your suggestion, sir, is a most absurd one.\r\n\r\nI meekly answered that I had spoken without knowing all the facts. My\r\nsubmission pleased him and led him to further confidences.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure, sir, that I have very good grounds before I come to\r\nan opinion. I have seen the boy again and again with his bundle. Every\r\nday, and sometimes twice a day, I have been able -- but wait a moment,\r\nDr. Watson. Do my eyes deceive me, or is there at the present moment\r\nsomething moving upon that hill- side?\r\n\r\nIt was several miles off, but I could distinctly see a small dark dot\r\nagainst the dull green and gray.\r\n\r\nCome, sir, come! cried Frankland, rushing upstairs. You will see\r\nwith your own eyes and judge for yourself.\r\n\r\nThe telescope, a formidable instrument mounted upon a tripod, stood upon\r\nthe flat leads of the house. Frankland clapped his eye to it and gave a\r\ncry of satisfaction.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
