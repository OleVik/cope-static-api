{"attributes":{},"body":"That is a private matter. I cannot tell it.\r\n\r\nYou acknowledge then that you made an appointment with Sir Charles at\r\nthe very hour and place at which he met his death, but you deny that you\r\nkept the appointment.\r\n\r\nThat is the truth.\r\n\r\nAgain and again I cross-questioned her, but I could never get past that\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lyons, said I, as I rose from this long and inconclusive\r\ninterview, you are taking a very great responsibility and putting\r\nyourself in a very false position by not making an absolutely clean\r\nbreast of all that you know. If I have to call in the aid of the police\r\nyou will find how seriously you are compromised. If your position is\r\ninnocent, why did you in the first instance deny having written to Sir\r\nCharles upon that date?\r\n\r\nBecause I feared that some false conclusion might be drawn from it and\r\nthat I might find myself involved in a scandal.\r\n\r\nAnd why were you so pressing that Sir Charles should destroy your\r\nletter?\r\n\r\nIf you have read the letter you will know.\r\n\r\nI did not say that I had read all the letter.\r\n\r\nYou quoted some of it.\r\n\r\nI quoted the postscript. The letter had, as I said, been burned and it\r\nwas not all legible. I ask you once again why it was that you were so\r\npressing that Sir Charles should destroy this letter which he received\r\non the day of his death.\r\n\r\nThe matter is a very private one.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
