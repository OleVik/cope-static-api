When I was watching Stapleton, Cartwright was frequently\r\nwatching you, so that I was able to keep my hand upon all the strings.\r\n\r\nI have already told you that your reports reached me rapidly, being\r\nforwarded instantly from Baker Street to Coombe Tracey. They were of\r\ngreat service to me, and especially that one incidentally truthful piece\r\nof biography of Stapleton's.
