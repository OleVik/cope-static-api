{"attributes":{},"body":"And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am\r\nnot a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this house\r\nmy slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two in the\r\nmorning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I rose,\r\nopened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was trailing down\r\nthe corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly down the passage\r\nwith a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and trousers, with no\r\ncovering to his feet. I could merely see the outline, but his height\r\ntold me that it was Barrymore. He walked very slowly and circumspectly,\r\nand there was something indescribably guilty and furtive in his whole\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nI have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs\r\nround the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I waited\r\nuntil he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When I came\r\nround the balcony he had reached the end of the farther corridor, and I\r\ncould see from the glimmer of light through an open door that he had\r\nentered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are unfurnished and\r\nunoccupied, so that his expedition became more mysterious than ever. The\r\nlight shone steadily as if he were standing motionless. I crept down the\r\npassage as noiselessly as I could and peeped round the corner of the\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\nBarrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against the\r\nglass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face seemed to be\r\nrigid with expectation as he stared out into the blackness of the moor.\r\nFor some minutes he stood watching intently. Then he gave a deep groan\r\nand with an impatient gesture he put out the light. Instantly I made my\r\nway back to my room, and very shortly came the stealthy steps passing\r\nonce more upon their return journey. Long afterwards\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
