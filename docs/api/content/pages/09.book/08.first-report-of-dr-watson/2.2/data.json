{"attributes":{},"body":"as to whether the sun moved round the earth or the earth round the sun.\r\nLet me, therefore, return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.\r\n\r\nIf you have not had any report within the last few days it is because up\r\nto to-day there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very\r\nsurprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due course.\r\nBut, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the other\r\nfactors in the situation.\r\n\r\nOne of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped\r\nconvict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he has\r\ngot right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely\r\nhouseholders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his flight,\r\nduring which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard of him. It\r\nis surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon the moor during\r\nall that time. Of course, so far as his concealment goes there is no\r\ndifficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would give him a\r\nhiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were to catch and\r\nslaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore, that he has gone,\r\nand the outlying farmers sleep the better in consequence.\r\n\r\nWe are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take\r\ngood care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments\r\nwhen I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.\r\nThere are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother, the\r\nlatter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands of a\r\ndesperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal, if he could once\r\neffect an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their\r\nsituation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over to\r\nsleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
