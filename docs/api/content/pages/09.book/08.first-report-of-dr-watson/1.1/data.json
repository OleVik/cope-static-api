{"attributes":{},"body":"\\> From this point onward I will follow the course of events by\r\ntranscribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before me\r\non the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly as\r\nwritten and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more\r\naccurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events, can\r\npossibly do.\r\n\r\nBaskerville Hall, October 13th.\r\n\r\nMY DEAR HOLMES, -- My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty\r\nwell up to date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken\r\ncorner of the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit\r\nof the moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim\r\ncharm. When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of\r\nmodern England behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious\r\neverywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On all\r\nsides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk, with\r\ntheir graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have marked\r\ntheir temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against the scarred\r\nhill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you were to see a\r\nskin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door fitting a flint-tipped\r\narrow on to the string of his bow, you would feel that his presence\r\nthere was more natural than your own. The strange thing is that they\r\nshould have lived so thickly on what must always have been most\r\nunfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I could imagine that they were\r\nsome unwarlike and harried race who were forced to accept that which\r\nnone other would occupy.\r\n\r\nAll this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and\r\nwill probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind. I\r\ncan still remember your complete indifference\r\n","bodyBegin":1}
